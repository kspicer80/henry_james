I knew the next day that <span>a letter containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his <span class="placeName">London</span> apartments</span>; <span>but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening,</span> in fact, <span>as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed.</span> Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again <span>before the fire in the hall,</span> as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. <span>It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.</span> Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, <span>from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give.</span> Poor <span class="persName">Douglas</span>, before his death—when it was in sight—<span>committed to me the manuscript</span> <span>that reached him on the third of these days</span> and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, <span>he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.</span> <span>The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay:</span> they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made <span>his little final auditory</span> more compact and select, kept it, <span>round the hearth,</span> subject to a common thrill.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.38"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.38. </span></h3><p>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to <span class="placeName">Hampshire</span>London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in <span class="placeName"><span class="address"><span class="name">Harley Street</span></span></span>, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream <span>or an old novel,</span> before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a <span class="placeName">Hampshire</span> vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in <span class="placeName">Essex</span>, that he wished her immediately to proceed.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.39"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.39. </span></h3><p>He had been left, by the death of their parents in <span class="placeName">India</span>, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—<span>very heavily on his hands.</span> It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, <span>to see how they were doing.</span> The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of <span class="placeName">Bly</span>, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little <span class="persName">Miles</span>. <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for <span class="persName">Flora</span>; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.40"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.40. </span></h3><p>So far had <span class="persName">Douglas</span> presented his picture when someone put a question.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.41"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.41. </span></h3><p><span class="said">‘“And what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.42"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.42. </span></h3><p>Our friend’s answer was prompt. <span class="said">‘“That will come out.

After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, <span>toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness</span> seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the <span>golden</span> sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I had received in <span class="placeName"><span class="address"><span class="name">Harley Street</span></span></span> a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.2. </span></h3><p>I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> <span>appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen,</span> and I afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me, too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, <span>as I almost felt it,</span> the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, <span>I could see myself from head to foot,</span> all struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance <span>of her being so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.3. </span></h3><p>But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as <span>the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty</span> had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; <span>to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch,</span> and <span>to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard.</span> <span>There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; </span> there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. <span>But these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me. </span> <span>To watch,</span> teach, “form” little <span class="persName">Flora</span> would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at night, her small <span>white</span> bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were naturally things that in <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.4. </span></h3><p><span class="said">‘<span>“And the little boy—does he look like her?</span> Is he too so very remarkable?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.5"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.5. </span></h3><p>One wouldn’t flatter a child. <span class="said">‘“Oh, miss, <em class="italics">most</em> remarkable.

They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. <span>Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay;</span> I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen <span class="placeName">Bly</span> since the day I left it, <span>and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes </span> it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of <span>gold</span> and her frock of <span>blue</span>, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, <span>I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and a dream? </span> No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span></h2><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.1. </span></h3><p>This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with <span class="persName">Flora</span> to meet, as <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. <span>The postbag, that evening—it came late—contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken. </span> <span><span class="quote">‘“This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster’s an awful bore.

What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft ona great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I couldd eal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies.Lessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that hadn ot been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned tobe amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. <span>I used to speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. </span> They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the after years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a beast.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.15"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.15. </span></h3><p>In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest,gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I <em class="italics">could</em>, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.16"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.16. </span></h3><p>It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be with me in these wanderings <span>was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. </span> I didn’t ask more than that—I only asked that he should <em class="italics">know;</em> and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot—<span>and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for</span>—was the sense that <span>my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. </span> He did stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little <span class="persName">Flora</span> had conducted me.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.17"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.17. </span></h3><p>This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, <span>from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past. </span> I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.18"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.18. </span></h3><p>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. <span>There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. </span> An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was—a few more seconds assured me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in <span class="placeName"><span class="address"><span class="name">Harley Street</span></span></span>—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. <span>I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the <span>golden</span> sky, and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice.</span> But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The <span>gold</span> was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was <span>as definite as a picture in a frame. </span> That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.19"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.19. </span></h3><p>The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, <span>lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities,</span> none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this visitant, at all events—and there was <span>a touch of the strange freedom, </span> as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—<span>seemed to fix me, </span> from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. <span>We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. </span> He was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. <span>So I saw him as I see the letters I form on this page;</span> then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed his place—passed, <span>looking at me hard all the while, </span> to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this transit <span>he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment <span>the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next. </span></span> He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly <span>fixed me.</span> He turned away; that was all I knew.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span></h2><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.1. </span></h3><p>It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken.

Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>. <span>This picture comes back to me </span> in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide <span>white</span> panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and <span>red</span> carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway, <span>under her contact,</span> that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. <span>I had not suspected in advance that <span>her comfortable face would pull me up, </span></span> and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself <span>hesitate to mention it</span>. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall <span>and with her eyes on me, </span> I, for a reason that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.2. </span></h3><p>Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then stolen out as he came. <span>If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him. </span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.3. </span></h3><p>This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work. My charming work was just my life with <span class="persName">Miles</span> and <span class="persName">Flora</span>, and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the <span>romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. </span> I don’t mean by this, of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the real <span>rose</span> flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid, unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.4. </span></h3><p>Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made <span class="persName">Miles</span> a muff) that kept them—how shall I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to whack! I remember feeling with <span class="persName">Miles</span> in especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have <span>“caught” it, and I should have caught it by the rebound</span>—I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than one. <span>I was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home, </span> where things were not going well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.5"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.5. </span></h3><p>There was a Sunday—to get on—when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up” dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, <span>but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. </span> <span>One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. </span> <span>The person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. </span> <span>He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood. </span> <span>His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds—long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always. </span> Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; <span>his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. </span> On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for someone else.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5_div.6"><h3><span class="headingNumber">5.6. </span></h3><p>The <span>flash</span> of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose today of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn’t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had stood. I did so; <span>I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had looked,</span> into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, as I had done for himself just before, came in from the hall. <span>With this I had the full image</span> of a <span>repetition of what had already occurred. </span> <span>She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;</span> she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I had received. She turned <span>white</span>, and this made me ask myself if I had blanched as much. <span>She stared,</span> in short, and retreated on just <em class="italics">my </em> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to mention. I wondered why <em class="italics">she</em> should be scared.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span></h2><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.1. </span></h3><p>Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, <span>she loomed again into view. </span> <span class="said">‘<span>“What in the name of goodness is the matter—?” </span>’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.2. </span></h3><p>She was now flushed and out of breath.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.3. </span></h3><p>I said nothing till she came quite near. <span class="said">‘“With me?” ’</span> I must have made a wonderful face. <span class="said">‘“Do I show it?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.4. </span></h3><p><span class="said">‘<span>“You’re as <span>white</span> as a sheet.

There had been, this evening, after the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate—there had been, for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out.

Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours in especial—for it may be imagined whether I slept—still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. <span>I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> had kept back.</span> I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high I had restlessly <span>read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and morecruel occurrences. </span> What they gave me above all was just the sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of the months he had continuously passed at <span class="placeName">Bly</span>, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter’s morning, <span class="persName">Peter Quint</span> was found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final evidence, <em class="italics">had </em> been—by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.13_div.27"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.13.27. </span></h4><p>I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of me. <span>I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen</span>—oh, in the right quarter!—that I could succeed where many another girl might have failed. It was an immense help to me—I confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!—<span>that I saw my service so strongly and so simply. </span> I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I—well, I had <em class="italics">them</em>. It was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them. <span>The more I saw, the less they would. </span> <span>I began to watch them in a stifled suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too long, have turned to something like madness. </span> What saved me, <span>as I now see,</span> was that it turned to something else altogether.

We had left <span class="persName">Miles</span> indoors, on the <span>red</span> cushion of a deep window seat; <span>he had wished to finish a book, </span> and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. <span>I walked in a world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that <span class="persName">Flora</span> was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.13_div.29"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.13.29. </span></h4><p>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet <span>without direct vision</span>, the presence, at a distance, of a thin person.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.13_div.30"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.13.30. </span></h4><p>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour.

We were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, <span>when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. </span> <span>To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that,</span> I found I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it up,” I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it. <span>I encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence we took for granted</span>—I should get used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.15_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.15.2. </span></h4><p>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged afresh into <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s special society and there become aware—it was almost a luxury!— <span>that she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached. </span> <span>She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having “cried.” </span> I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. <span>To gaze into the depths of <span>blue</span> of the child’s eyes</span> and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>—as I did there, over and over, in the small hours—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl <span>saw our visitant even as I actually saw <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did!</span> It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.15_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.15.3. </span></h4><p>Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that <em class="italics">I</em> at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from <span>pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. </span> <span>She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal;</span> but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. <span class="said">‘“I don’t believe anything so horrible,” ’</span> I recollect saying; <span class="said">‘“no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don’t.

A very few of them, in fact, passing, <span>in constant sight of my pupils,</span> without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. <span>I trembled lest they should see that they <em class="italics">were </em> so immensely more interesting.</span> Putting things at the worst, at all events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, <span>I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. </span> As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself: <span class="said">‘“What will they think of that? Doesn’t it betray too much?” ’</span> It would have been easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, <span>so too I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations. </span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.2. </span></h4><p>They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, <span>literally to catch them at a purpose in it. </span> They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the “pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours. <span>They had shown me</span> from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for <span class="persName">Miles</span>. What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that hew asunder some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.3. </span></h4><p>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been “kicked out” by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—<span>I could follow no scent very far.</span> We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, <span>but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of catching and repeating. </span> The schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to “come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a <em class="italics">naïf </em> side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.4. </span></h4><p><span>I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge.</span> In going on with the record of what was hideous at <span class="placeName">Bly</span>, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance. One evening—with nothing to lead up or to prepare it—<span>I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me </span> the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. <span>I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at <span class="placeName">Bly</span>—last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand</span> was <span class="bibl"><span class="author">Fielding’s</span> <span class="titlem"><em class="italics">Amelia</em></span></span> ; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late <span>and a particular objection to looking at my watch. </span> I figure, finally, that the <span>white</span> curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, <span>looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. </span> There was a moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, <span>I laid down my book,</span> rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.5. </span></h4><p>I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, <span>till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. </span> At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, <span>I saw that there was someone on the stair. </span> I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with <span class="persName">Quint</span>. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, <span>where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden. </span> <span>:He knew me as well as I knew him;</span> and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn’t meet and measure him.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.6. </span></h4><p>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time, at least—to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous just because it <em class="italics">was</em> human, as human as to have met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. <span>It was the dead silence of our long gaze </span> at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed,in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.16_div.7"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.16.7. </span></h4><p>The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even <em class="italics">I</em> were in life. I can’t express what followed it save by saying that <span>the silence itself</span>—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength—became the element into which <span>I saw the figure disappear; </span> in which <span>:I definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of anorder, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost. </span></p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17"><h3><span class="headingNumber">7.17. </span></h3><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.1. </span></h4><p>I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. <span>The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s little bed was empty;</span> and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the <span>white</span> curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, <span>produced an answering sound:</span> <span>I perceived an agitation of the window blind,</span> and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her <span>pink</span> bare feet and the <span>golden</span> glow of her curls. <span>She looked intensely grave,</span> and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach. <span class="said">‘“You naughty: where <em class="italics">have </em> you been?”’</span> —instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, <span>and had jumped up to see what had become of me. </span> I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; <span>and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. </span> <span>I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the <span>blue</span> of her own.</span> <span class="said">‘<span>“You were looking for me out of the window?”</span>’</span> I said. <span class="said">‘“You thought I might be walking in the grounds?” ’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.2. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“Well, you know, I thought someone was”’</span>—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.3. </span></h4><p><span>Oh, how I looked at her now!</span> <span class="said">‘“And did you see anyone?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.4. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“Ah, <em class="italics">no!</em>”’</span> she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her little drawl of the negative.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.5. </span></h4><p>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied; <span>and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. </span> One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to withstand it, <span>I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. </span> Why not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her lovely little <span>lighted</span> face? <span class="said">‘<span>“You see, you see,</span> you <em class="italics">know</em> that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?”’</span> This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have spared myself—<span>well, you’ll see what.</span> Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet, <span>looked at her bed,</span> and took a helpless middle way.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.6. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?” ’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.7"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.7. </span></h4><p><span class="persName">Flora</span> <span>luminously considered</span>; after which, with her little divine smile: <span class="said">‘“Because I don’t like to frighten you!”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.8"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.8. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“But if I had, by your idea, gone out—?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.9"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.9. </span></h4><p>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she <span>turned her eyes </span> to the <span>flame of the candle</span> as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. <span class="said">‘“Oh, but you know,” ’</span> she quite adequately answered, <span class="said">‘“that you might come back, you dear, and that you <em class="italics">have!</em>”’</span> And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time,<span>by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, </span> to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.10"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.10. </span></h4><p>You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my nights. I <span>repeatedly </span> sat up till I didn’t know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met <span class="persName">Quint</span>.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.11"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.11. </span></h4><p>But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no other occasion <span>saw him in the house.</span> I just missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. <span>Looking down it from the top I once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands. </span> I had been there but an instant, however, <span>when she vanished without looking round at me. </span> <span>I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show;</span> and I wondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown <span class="persName">Quint</span>. Well, there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered now—I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused <span>as if a hand had shook me.</span> <span>I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that <span class="persName">Flora</span> had extinguished it.</span> This brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. <span>A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed the picture. </span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.12"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.12. </span></h4><p>The child had again got up— <span>this time blowing out the taper, </span> <span>and had again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the night. </span> <span>That she now saw—as she had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time—was proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. </span> Hidden, protected, absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened forward—and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in my quick decision. <span>She was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do. </span> What I, on my side, had to care for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some other window in the same quarter. <span>I got to the door without her hearing me; </span> I got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage <span>I had my eyes on her brother’s door,</span> which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What if I should go straight in and march to <em class="italics">his </em> window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my boldness?</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.13"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.13. </span></h4><p>This thought <span>held me sufficiently</span> to make me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and <span>he too were secretly at watch. </span> <span>It was a deep, soundless minute,</span> at the end of which my impulse failed. <span>He was quiet; he might be innocent;</span> the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds—<span>a figure prowling for a sight, </span> the visitor with whom <span class="persName">Flora</span> was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. <span>I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice. </span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.17_div.14"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.17.14. </span></h4><p>There were empty rooms at <span class="placeName">Bly</span>, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one—though high above the gardens—in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it <span>and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. </span> <span>Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass without a sound</span> and, applying my face to the pane, was able, <span>the darkness without being much less than within, to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. </span> There was clearly another person above me—there was a person on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I felt sick as I made it out—was poor little <span class="persName">Miles</span> himself.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.18"><h3><span class="headingNumber">7.18. </span></h3><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.18_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.18.1. </span></h4><p>It was not till late next day that I spoke to <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>; <span>the rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight </span> making it often difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries. <span>I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. </span> She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn’t I don’t know what would have become of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, <span>and if she could see in our little charges </span> nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. <span>If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, </span> she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, <span>when she surveyed them,</span> with her large <span>white</span> arms folded <span>and the habit of serenity in all her look,</span> thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, <span>to a steady fireside glow,</span> and I had already begun to perceive how, with the development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage that, to the world, <span>my face should tell no tales,</span> but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.18_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.18.2. </span></h4><p>At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, <span>reading aloud from a storybook</span> and <span>passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. </span> <span><span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> watched them with positive placidity;</span> then I caught the <span>suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. </span> I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my function—in her patience under my pain. She offred her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch’s broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what <span class="persName">Miles</span> had said to me when, <span>after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, </span> I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. <span>As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; </span> <span>on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where <span class="persName">Quint</span> had so hungrily hovered for him,</span> along the lobby <span>where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.18_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.18.3. </span></h4><p><span>Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us,</span> and I had wondered—oh, <em class="italics">how</em> I had wondered!—<span>if he were groping about in his little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque. </span> It would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <em class="italics">I</em> should. I was confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He “had” me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here, <span>how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. </span> I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful; <span>never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well </span> <span>under fire.</span> I had no alternative but, in form at least, to put it to him.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.18_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.18.4. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“You must tell me now—and all the truth.

This situation continued a month, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part of my pupils. It was not, I am as sure today as I was sure then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don’t mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement. <span>It was as if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind, </span> <span>closing with a little bang that made us look at each other—for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had intended—the doors we had indiscreetly opened. </span> All roads lead to Rome, and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: <span class="said">‘“She thinks she’ll do it this time—but she <em class="italics">won’t!</em>”’</span> To <span class="quote">‘“do it”’</span> would have been to indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round. They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my memory; <span>and nothing else perhaps, when I thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watched from under cover. </span> It was in any case over <em class="italics">my</em> life, <em class="italics">my</em> past, and <em class="italics">my </em> friends alone that we could take anything like our ease—a state of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was invited—with no visible connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling’s celebrated <span class="foreign"><em class="italics">mot</em></span> or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the vicarage pony.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.20_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.20.2. </span></h4><p>It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I have called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done something toward soothing my nerves. <span>Since the light brush, that second night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the foot of the stair, </span> <span>I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house, that one had better not have seen. </span> There was many a corner round which I expected to come upon <span class="persName">Quint</span>, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way, would have favored the appearance of <span class="persName">Miss Jessel</span>. The summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon <span class="placeName">Bly</span> and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its <span>gray </span> sky and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of the <em class="italics">kind</em> of ministering moment, that brought back to me, <span>long enough to catch it,</span> the feeling of the medium in which, that June evening out of doors, <span>I had had my first sight of <span class="persName">Quint</span>, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery.</span> <span>I recognized the signs, the portents—I recognized the moment, the spot. </span> But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. I had said in my talk with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> on that horrid scene of <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that, <span>whether the children really saw or not—since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. </span> I was ready to know the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that <span>my eyes might be sealed</span> just while theirs were most opened. <span>Well, my eyes <em class="italics">were</em> sealed,</span> it appeared, at present—a consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was, alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils. How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken out. <span class="said">‘“They’re here, they’re here, you little wretches,” ’</span> I would have cried, <span class="said">‘“and you can’t deny it now!”’</span>. <span>The little wretches </span> denied it with all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which—like the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night when, <span>looking out to see either <span class="persName">Quint</span> or <span class="persName">Miss Jessel</span> under the stars,</span> I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of <span class="persName">Quint</span> had played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, <span>I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might come to the point. </span> I approached it from one side and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself: <span class="said">‘“<em class="italics">They</em> have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness to speak!”’</span> I felt myself <span>crimson</span> and <span>I covered my face with my hands. </span> <span>After these secret scenes I chattered more than ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes occurred—I can call them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano. </span> Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they “passed,” as the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough for myself.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.20_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.20.3. </span></h4><p>What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, <span>whatever I had seen, </span> <span><span class="persName">Miles</span> and <span class="persName">Flora</span> saw <em class="italics">more</em>—things terrible and unguessable</span> and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with <span>repetition</span>, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril. <span class="said">‘“When do you think he _will_ come? Don’t you think <span>we <em class="italics">ought</em> to write?”</span>’</span> —there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for carrying off an awkwardness. <span class="quote">‘“He” ’</span> of course was their uncle in <span class="placeName"><span class="address"><span class="name">Harley Street</span></span></span>; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions. <span>He never wrote to them</span>—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him <span>when I let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises. They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them all to this hour. </span> This was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me. <span>There appears to me, moreover, as I look back, </span> no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them. Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn’t in these days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived. I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at least change, and it came with a rush.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.21"><h3><span class="headingNumber">7.21. </span></h3><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.21_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.21.1. </span></h4><p>Walking to church a certain Sunday morning, I had little <span class="persName">Miles</span> at my side and his sister, in advance of us and at <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>’s, well in sight. <span>It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and sharp, </span> made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me <span>that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, </span> in the way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion. <span>I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. </span> But all this belonged—I mean their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday by his uncle’s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, <span class="persName">Miles</span>’s whole title to independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because <span>I now see how, </span> with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated. <span class="said">‘“Look here, my dear, you know,” ’</span> he charmingly said, <span class="said">‘“when in the world, please, am I going back to school?” ’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.21_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.21.2. </span></h4><p><span>Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough,</span> <span>particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses. </span> <span>There was something in them that always made one “catch,” and I caught, </span> at any rate, now so effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though, toenable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and charming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: <span class="said">‘“You know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady <em class="italics">always</em>—!”’</span> His <span class="quote">‘“my dear”’</span> was constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity.

It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and <span>read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning; </span> by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What I said to myself above all was that <span class="persName">Miles</span> had got something out of me and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. <span>That his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. </span> The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to me: <span class="said">‘<span class="quote">‘“Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this <span>interruption of my studies, </span> or you cease to expect me to lead with you a life that’s so unnatural for a boy.”’</span>’</span> What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.22_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.22.2. </span></h4><p>That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked round the church, <span>hesitating, hovering;</span> I reflected that I had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up nothing, <span>and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk. </span> For the first minute since his arrival I wanted to get away from him. <span>As I paused beneath the high east window </span> and <span>listened to the sounds of worship,</span> I was taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give it the least encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which—I had the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in their train.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.22_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.22.3. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“What <em class="italics">did</em> you do, you naughty, bad thing?

It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more than a month before, <span>in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of the most horrible of women. </span> At this I was able to straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to take. <span>But I opened the door to find again, in a flash, my eyes unsealed. </span> <span>In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight back upon my resistance. </span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.22_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.22.5. </span></h4><p>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom <span>table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. </span> There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; <span>but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away. </span> Dark as midnight in her <span>black</span> dress, her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, <span>she had looked at me </span> long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—<span class="said">‘“You terrible, miserable woman!”’</span>— <span>I heard myself break into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. </span> <span>She looked at me</span> <span>as if she heard me,</span> but I had recovered myself and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.23"><h3><span class="headingNumber">7.23. </span></h3><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.23_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.23.1. </span></h4><p>I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into account that they were dumb about my absence.

Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of <em class="italics">my</em> feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in <span class="persName">Miles</span> in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, <span>to the uninitiated eye</span> all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which <span>my initiated view betrayed me; to check the irrelevant gaze </span> and <span>discouraged sigh</span> in which I constantly both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of all evil <em class="italics">had </em> been opened up to him: all the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into an act.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.25_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.25.3. </span></h4><p>He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if I shouldn’t like him, for half an hour, to play to me. <span class="allusion">David playing to Saul</span> could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: <span class="said">‘<span class="quote">‘“The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that—to be let alone yourself and not followed up—you’ll cease to worry and spy upon me, won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I ‘come,’ you see—but I don’t go! There’ll be plenty of time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you that I contended for a principle.” ’</span>’</span> It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal <span>or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand, </span> to the schoolroom. <span>He sat down at the old piano and played as he had never played; </span> and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon, <span>and by the schoolroom fire, </span> and yet I hadn’t really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was <span class="persName">Flora</span>? When I put the question to <span class="persName">Miles</span>, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say: <span class="said">‘“Why, my dear, how do <em class="italics">I </em> know?”’</span> —breaking moreover into a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song. I went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, <span>I looked into several others. </span> As she was nowhere about she would surely be with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. <span>I found her where I had found her the evening before,</span> but she met my quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, <span>for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out of my sight </span> without some special provision. Of course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was <span>to look for her</span> without an air of alarm.

If I had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with <span class="persName">Miles</span>, <span>I speedily perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. </span> No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates. Now I <em class="italics">was</em>, I said to myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, <span>I could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis. </span> <span>What had happened naturally caused them all to stare; </span> there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we might, in the suddenness of my colleague’s act. <span>The maids and the men looked blank;</span> the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation <span>until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid.</span> <span>It was precisely, in short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; </span> and I dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place and <span>looked, </span> I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart.</p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.29_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.29.2. </span></h4><p>The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little <span class="persName">Miles</span> himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, <span>no glimpse of him, </span> but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in <span class="persName">Flora</span>’s interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. <span>He had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span> and his sister.</span> He had then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, <span>could better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office. </span> What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps <span>sprung</span> highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; <span>I was never to touch it again;</span> <span>as I had amply shown,</span> moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, <span>for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.29_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.29.3. </span></h4><p>To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of which I had had from <span class="persName">Mrs. Grose</span>, that first scared Sunday, <span>my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light. </span> Here at present I felt afresh—for I had felt it <span>again and again</span>seg&gt;—how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid <span>will, the will</span> <span>to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the truth</span> that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against nature. I could only get on at all by taking “nature” into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal <span>as a push in a direction unusual, </span> of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <em class="italics">all</em> the nature. How could I put even a little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand, could I make <span>reference</span> without a new plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably, <span>by the quickened vision </span> of what was rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now—as he had so often <span>found</span> at lessons—still some other delicate way to ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him? <span>Mightn’t one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? </span> It was as if, <span>when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the way. </span> The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with attendance. <span class="persName">Miles</span>, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he presently produced was: <span class="said">‘“I say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?” ’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.29_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.29.4. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“Little <span class="persName">Flora</span>?

Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; <span>and he dropped into peaceful silence</span>, while he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense, and I had the things immediately removed.

I had always my hypocrisy of “work,” behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I extracted a meaning from the boy’s embarrassed back—none other than the impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively <em class="italics">he </em> who was. <span>The frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image, </span> for him, of a kind of failure. <span>I felt that I saw him,</span> at any rate, shut in or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope. <span>Wasn’t he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn’t see?</span>—and wasn’t it the first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? <span>The first, the very first:</span> I found it a splendid portent. <span>It made him anxious, though he watched himself; </span> he had been anxious all day and, <span>even while in his usual sweet little manner </span> he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius <span>to give it a gloss.</span> When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. <span class="said">‘“Well, I think I’m glad <span class="placeName">Bly</span> <span>agrees with <em class="italics">me!</em>”</span>’</span> <span class="said">‘<span>“You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than for some time before. </span> I hope,”’</span> I went on bravely, <span class="said">‘“that you’ve been enjoying yourself.”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.30_div.7"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.30.7. </span></h4><p><span class="said">‘“Oh, yes, I’ve been ever so far; all round about—<span>miles and miles away.</span> I’ve never been so free.”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.30_div.8"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.30.8. </span></h4><p>He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with him. <span class="said">‘“Well, do you like it?”’</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.30_div.9"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.30.9. </span></h4><p><span>He stood there smiling;</span> then at last he put into two words— <span class="said">‘“Do <em class="italics">you?</em>”’</span> — <span>more discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain.</span></p></div><div class="paragraph" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7_div.30_div.10"><h4><span class="headingNumber">7.30.10. </span></h4><p>Before I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with the sense that this was <span>an impertinence to be softened.</span> <span class="said">‘“Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone together now it’s you that are alone most.
