            <div type='paragraph' n='1'>
                          The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.
                        </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='2'>
                <said who='Douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin'>“I quite agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to <emph rend='italics'>two</emph> children—?""</said>
              </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='3'>
                <said who='storygroup' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin douglas'>“We say, of course,”</said> somebody exclaimed, <said who='storygroupmember' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin douglas'>“that they give two turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</said>
              </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='4'>I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. “Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.” This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: “It’s beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.”
                        </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='5'>
                <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“For sheer terror?”</said> I remember asking.
                        </div>
                <div type='paragraph' n='6'>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“For dreadful—dreadfulness!”</said>
                <said who='storygroupmember' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas narrator'>“Oh, how delicious!”</said> cried one of the women.
                      </div>
                <div type='paragraph' n='7'>He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator storygroupmember mrsgriffin'>“For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain.”</said>
              </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='8'>
                <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“Well then,”</said> I said, <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“just sit right down and begin.”</said>
              </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='9'>He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant. Then as he faced us again: <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“I can’t begin. I shall have to send to town.”</said> There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator'>“The story’s written. It’s in a locked drawer—it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.”</said> It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt.
                    </div>
              <div type='paragraph' n='10'>
                <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“Oh, thank God, no!”</said>
                <div type='paragraph' n='11'>“And is the record yours? You took the thing down?”</said>

                    <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“I’ve never lost it.”</said>

                      <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“Then your manuscript—?”</said>
                    </div>

                      <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.”</said> He hung fire again. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“A woman’s. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the pages in question before she died.”</said> They were all listening now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister’s governess,”</said> he quietly said. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“She was the most agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before. I was at <place>Trinity</place>, and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer. I was much there that year—it was a beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don’t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had never told anyone. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn’t. I was sure; I could see. You’ll easily judge why when you hear.”</said>
                    </div>
                    <div type='paragraph' n='16'>
                      <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“Because the thing had been such a scare?”</said>
                    </div>
                    <div type='paragraph' n='17'>He continued to fix me. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator'>“You’ll easily judge,”</said> he repeated: “<emph rend='italics'>you</emph>will.”</said>
                  </div>
                  <div type='paragraph' n='18'>I fixed him, too. <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“I see. She was in love.”</said>
                </div>
                <div type='paragraph' n='19'>He laughed for the first time. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator'>“You <emph rend='italics'>are</emph> acute. Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been. That came out—she couldn’t tell her storywithout its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither ofus spoke of it. I remember the time and the place—the corner of thelawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summerafternoon. It wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh—!”</said> He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.

                <div type='paragraph' n='20'>
                  <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“You’ll receive the packet Thursday morning?”</said> I inquired.

                    <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator'>“Probably not till the second post.”</said>

                    <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“You’ll all meet me here?”</said> He looked us round again. <said who='douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmember'>“Isn’t anybody going?”</said> It was almost the tone of hope.
                  </div>
                  <div type='paragraph' n='24'>
                    <said who='narrator'>“Everybody will stay!”</said>

                  <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='mrsgriffin'>“The story will tell,”</said> I took upon myself to reply.

                <div type='paragraph' n='29'>
                  <said who='mrsgriffin' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“More’s the pity, then. That’s the only way I ever understand.”</said>

                  <said who='storygroupmember' aloud='true' toWhom='douglas'>“Won’t <emph rend='italics'>you</emph> tell, Douglas?”</said> somebody else inquired.
                      </div>
                  <div type='paragraph' n='31'>He sprang to his feet again. <said who-'douglas' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator mrsgriffin storygroupmembers'>“Yes—tomorrow. Now I must go to bed. Good
                      night.”</said> And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly
                      bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on
                      the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. <said who='mrsgriffin' aloud='true' toWhom='narrator storygroupmembers'>“Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I know who <emph rend='italics'>he</emph> was.”</said>

                    <said who='mrgriffin' aloud='true' toWhom='mrsgriffin'>“Forty years!”</said> Griffin put in.

                    <div type='paragraph' n='35'>
                      <said who='mrsgriffin' aloud='true' toWhom='mrgriffin'>“With this outbreak at last.”</said>
                    </div>
                    <div type='paragraph' n='36'>
                      <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='mrsgriffin mrgriffin storygroupmembers'>“The outbreak,”</said> I returned, <said who='narrator' aloud='true' toWhom='mrsgriffin mrgriffin storygroupmembers'>“will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;”</said> and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for everything else. The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and “candlestuck,” as somebody said, and went to bed. I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death—when it was in sight—committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.
                    </div>
                    <div type='paragraph' n='37'>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.
                  </div>
                  <div type='paragraph' n='38'>He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—very heavily on his hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.

      <div type='paragraph' n='1'>
				I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a
				little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town,
				to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found
				myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this
				state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that
				carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle
				from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I
				found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in
				waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a
				country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly
				welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue,
				encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
				which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something
				so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a
				most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and
				fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn
				and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and
				the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the
				golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair
				from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door,
				with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent
				a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I
				had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that,
				as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a
				gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond
				his promise.
			</div>
			<div type='paragraph' n='2'>
				I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly
				through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my
				pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on
				the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have
				to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I
				afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I
				slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me,
				too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the
				liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of
				the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the
				full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time,
				I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the
				extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It
				was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with
				Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I
				had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook
				might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being
				so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so
				glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively
				on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little
				why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with
				suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.
			</div>
			<div type='paragraph' n='3'>
				But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection
				with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the
				vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to
				do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times
				rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and
				prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look
				at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to
				listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter,
				for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not
				without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a
				moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child;
				there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as
				at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies
				were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the
				light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent
				matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, “form” little
				Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It
				had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I
				should have her as a matter of course at night, her small white bed
				being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken
				was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time,
				with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my
				inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this
				timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had
				been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of
				uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of
				one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her,
				and to determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It
				was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I
				could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with
				four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib,
				brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were
				naturally things that in Flora’s presence could pass between us only as
				prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.
