                        remark that it was gruesome, as, on <date when="--12-24">Christmas
                            Eve</date> in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I
                        remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the
                        only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. <seg
                            ana="repetition">The case,</seg> I may mention, was that of an
                        apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an
                        appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with
                        his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to
                        dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also,
                        herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had <seg

                        It was this observation that drew from <persName ref="douglas"
                            >Douglas</persName>—not immediately, but <time>later in the
                            evening</time>—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I
                        call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">which I saw he was not following.</seg> This I
                        took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should
                        only have to wait. We waited in fact till <date when="--12-26">two nights
                            later</date>; but that before we scattered, he brought out what was in
                        his mind.</p>

                        carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from
                        the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, <seg
                            ana="weather">toward the close of the <time when="--06">June</time>
                            <time>afternoon</time>, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at
                            that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the <time
                                type="season">summer</time> sweetness</seg> seemed to offer me a
                        friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the
                        avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
                        which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so
                        melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most
                        pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh
                        curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the
                        bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered
                        treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the <seg
                            ana="colors-golden">golden</seg> sky. The scene had a greatness that
                        made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately
                        appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who
                        dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a
                        distinguished visitor. I had received in <listPlace>

                        made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what
                        I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise. </p>

                        adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large,
                        impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, <seg

                        struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things
                        thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should
                        get on with <persName ref="mrsgrose">Mrs. Grose</persName> in a relation
                        over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only
                        thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was
                        the clear circumstance <seg ana="vision-physical">of her being so glad to

                            her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why
                            she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with
                            suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</seg>

                            <persName ref="mrsgrose">Mrs. Grose</persName> only as an effect of our
                        consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In
                        spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the

                    <p>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall the
                        way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little
                        distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I
                        had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm,
                        apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult
                        connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft ona great wave of
                        infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and
                        perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education
                        for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to
                        remember at <time>this day</time> what proposal I framed for the end of his
                        holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that
                        charming <date type="season">summer</date>, we all had a theory that he was
                        to have; but I now feel that, <time>for weeks</time>, the lessons must have
                        been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that hadn ot
                        been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned tobe amused,
                        and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in
                        a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of
                        summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and
                        consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my
                        imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was
                        most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my
                        guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so
                        extraordinary. <seg ana="touch-figurative">I used to speculate—but even this
                            with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures
                            are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. </seg> They had the
                        bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair
                        of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be
                        right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my
                        fancy, the after years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really
                        royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all,
                        that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of
                        stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was
                        actually like the spring of a beast. </p>

                    <p>In the <time>first weeks</time> the days were long; they often, at their

                        pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final
                        retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,

                        in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds
                        and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the
                        beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel
                        myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by
                        my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving
                        pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had
                        responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly
                        asked of me, and that I <emph rend="italics">could</emph>, after all, do it
                        proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself,
                        in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this
                        would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front
                        to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign. </p>

                        thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be
                        with me in these wanderings <seg ana="reading romance books">was that it

                        was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long <date

                        as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were
                        probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not
                        being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their

                        me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my
                        mind. I had not seen it in <listPlace>

                        </listPlace>—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the

                        appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with
                        a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the
                        moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the

                        curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall
                        that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in
                        the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling
                        about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much
                        more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human
                        chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had
                        been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting <persName

                        friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me
                        straightway, <seg ana="touch-figurative">under her contact,</seg> that, with
                        plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing
                        whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. <seg
                            ana="vision-figurative">I had not suspected in advance that <seg

                        </seg> and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus

                        anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real
                        beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my
                        companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">and with her eyes on me, </seg> I, for a reason
                        that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a
                        vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night
                        and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room. </p>

                    <p>Here it was another affair; here, <date>for many days after</date>, it was a
                        queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there
                        were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up
                        to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear
                        to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had
                        now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at
                        no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and
                        yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see
                        that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any
                        domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my
                        senses; I felt sure, <date>at the end of three days</date> and as the result
                        of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants
                        nor made the object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing
                        was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a
                        liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and
                        locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an
                        intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his
                        way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and
                        then stolen out as he came. <seg ana="vision-physical">If he had given me
                            such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The

                        what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
                        work. My charming work was just my life with <persName ref="miles"

                        myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant
                        joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the
                        distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my
                        office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so
                        how could work not be charming that presented itself as <date>daily</date>
                        beauty? It was all the <seg ana="reading romance books">romance of the

                        otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe
                        that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel
                        for a <rs ref="governess" type="person">governess</rs>: I call the
                        sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one
                        direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity
                        continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been
                        promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang.
                        Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he
                        himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My
                        conclusion bloomed there with the real <seg ana="colors-rose">rose</seg>
                        flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid,
                        unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely
                        that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always,
                        on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid
                        headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive. </p>

                        I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were
                        like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to

                        extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any

                        as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been
                        wicked he would have <seg ana="repetition"> “caught” it, and I should have

                        nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school,
                        never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too
                        much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the
                        wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave
                        myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than
                        one. <seg ana="letters">I was in receipt in <date>these days</date> of

                        consequence of which, as <date>the day</date> declined, I had arranged with

                        dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover
                        them. <date>The day</date> was gray enough, but <time>the afternoon</time>
                        light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only

                            of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the

                            to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been

                            several other things. </seg> On the spot there came to me the added
                        shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come
                        for someone else. </p>

                <div type="paragraph" n="6">
                    <p>The <seg ana="vision">flash</seg> of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in
                        the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as
                        I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because
                        I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door
                        again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and,
                        passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came
                        full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I
                        stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the
                        whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it <time>time</time>, but
                        how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <date>today</date> of the
                        duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they
                        couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace
                        and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of
                        the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big
                        trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed
                        him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn’t see him. I got
                        hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went
                        to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself
                        where he had stood. I did so; <seg ana="vision-physical">I applied my face
                            to the pane and looked, as he had looked,</seg> into the room. As if, at
                        this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, <persName
                            ref="mrsgrose">Mrs. Grose</persName>, as I had done for himself just
                        before, came in from the hall. <seg ana="vision-figurative">With this I had
                            the full image</seg> of a <seg ana="repetition">repetition of what had

                        <seg ana="vision-physical">She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;</seg>
                        she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I
                        had received. She turned <seg ana="colors-white">white</seg>, and this made
                        me ask myself if I had blanched as much. <seg ana="vision-physical">She

                        that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited
                        I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to
                        mention. I wondered why <emph rend="italics">she</emph> should be scared.

                        at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after

                    <p>This moment dated from <time>an afternoon hour</time> that I happened to
                        spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left
                            <persName ref="miles">Miles</persName> indoors, on the <seg
                            ana="colors-red">red</seg> cushion of a deep window seat; <seg
                            ana="reading books">he had wished to finish a book, </seg> and I had
                        been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only
                        defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the
                        contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her <time>half an
                            hour</time>, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day
                        exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like
                        her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let
                        me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing
                        to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My
                        attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely
                        without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that
                        engaged me as an active admirer. <seg ana="imaginative play">I walked in a
                            world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon
                            mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some
                            remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that
                            was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
                            distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I
                            only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and
                            that <persName ref="flora">Flora</persName> was playing very hard. We
                            were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the
                            lake was the <geogName type="sea">Sea of Azof.</geogName></seg>

                <div type="paragraph" n="42">
                    <p>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of
                        the <geogName type="sea">Sea of Azof</geogName>, we had an interested
                        spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in
                        the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it
                        quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was
                        something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked
                        the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet
                            <seg ana="vision">without direct vision</seg>, the presence, at a
                        distance, of a thin person. </p>

                    <p>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it
                        was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no
                        ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one
                        moment to another found myself forming as to <seg ana="vision-physical">what
                            I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of
                            raising my eyes. </seg> They were attached at this juncture to the
                        stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my
                        effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able
                        to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure
                        whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect
                        counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was
                        more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the
                        place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman’s boy, from the
                        village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I
                        was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character
                        and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things
                        should be the other things that they absolutely were not. </p>

                    <p>What I had said to <persName ref="mrsgrose">Mrs. Grose</persName> was true
                        enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and
                        possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once
                        more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of
                        resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should
                        keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in
                        our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. <time>Late that

                        disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the
                        exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished
                        of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to
                        assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a

                        professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my

                        and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged

                        judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely
                        wanting to, but I could repeat to <persName ref="mrsgrose">Mrs.
                            Grose</persName>—as I did there, over and over, in the small

                        one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell
                        to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that,
                        somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the
                        signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of
                        my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the
                        certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a
                        revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter,
                        for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver
                        out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as

                        which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of
                        movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of
                        nonsense, and the invitation to romp. </p>

                        taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, <seg

                        easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the
                        real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was
                        that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective
                        even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it
                        occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little

                        was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment
                        must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of
                        cleverness. He was too clever for a bad <rs ref="governess" type="person"

                        schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their

                        “come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no
                        revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little
                        boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world
                        who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a
                        consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never
                        either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for
                        their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into
                        coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between
                        them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped
                        away. There is a <emph rend="italics">naïf </emph> side, I suppose, in all

                        quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was
                        precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I
                        had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at <time>my old

                        one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused
                            <seg ana="touch-figurative">as if a hand had shook me.</seg>

                    <p>It was not till <date>late next day</date> that I spoke to <persName

                            rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight </seg> making it often
                        difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance
                        of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
                        children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
                        mysteries. <seg ana="vision-physical">I drew a great security in this
                            particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh
                            face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. </seg> She believed
                        me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn’t I don’t know what would have
                        become of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business alone. But she was a
                        magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">and if she could see in our little charges </seg>
                        nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she
                        had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">If they had been at all visibly blighted or
                            battered, </seg> she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back,
                        haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her,
                            <seg ana="vision-physical">when she surveyed them,</seg> with her large
                            <seg ana="colors-white">white</seg> arms folded <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">and the habit of serenity in all her look,</seg>
                        thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still
                        serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, <seg ana="fire">to a steady
                            fireside glow,</seg> and I had already begun to perceive how, with the
                        development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public
                        accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she
                        addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their
                        instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage
                        that, to the world, <seg ana="vision-physical">my face should tell no
                            tales,</seg> but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added
                        strain to find myself anxious about hers.</p>

                    <p><time>At the hour</time> I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on

                        the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before
                        us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to
                        and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison,
                        below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, <seg ana="reading books"

                            watched them with positive placidity;</seg> then I caught the <seg
                            ana="sound-figurative">suppressed intellectual creak with which she
                            conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the
                            tapestry. </seg> I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there
                        was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my
                        function—in her patience under my pain. She offred her mind to my
                        disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch’s broth and proposed it with
                        assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become
                        thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of
                            <time>the night</time>, I reached the point of what <persName
                            ref="miles">Miles</persName> had said to me when, <seg
                            ana="vision-physical">after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost
                            on the very spot where he happened now to be, </seg> I had gone down to
                        bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not
                        alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had
                        left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with
                        success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the
                        little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy
                        met my final articulate challenge. <seg ana="vision-physical">As soon as I
                            appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight

                    <p><seg ana="sound-physical">Not a sound, on the way, had passed between

                            wondered!—<seg ana="touch-figurative">if he were groping about in his

                        would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real
                        embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the
                        inscrutable! He couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce
                        would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb
                        of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <emph
                            rend="italics">I</emph> should. I was confronted at last, as never yet,
                        with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I
                        remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed
                        had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight,
                        made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I
                        remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the
                        force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He
                        could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I
                        should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those
                        caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He “had” me
                        indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would
                        consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture,
                        I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so
                        dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to <persName

                        had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not
                        one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the

                        conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of
                        the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might
                        survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days

                        lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless
                        appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again
                        treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened

                        as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the
                        furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old
                        women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to
                        chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round.
                        They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my

                            thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being

                        performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of
                        the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of
                        the <emph rend="italics">kind</emph> of ministering moment, that brought

                        and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young
                        woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined
                        but deepened. I had said in my talk with <persName ref="mrsgrose">Mrs.

                        it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to
                        keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,
                            <seg ana="vision-physical">whether the children really saw or not—since,
                            that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a
                            safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. </seg> I was ready to know
                        the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of
                        was that <seg ana="vision-figurative">my eyes might be sealed</seg> just
                        while theirs were most opened. <seg ana="repetition">Well, my eyes <emph

                        consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was,
                        alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had
                        I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my
                        pupils. How can I retrace <date>today</date> the strange steps of my
                        obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been
                        ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of
                        it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was
                        that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might
                        prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken
                        out. <said who="governess" aloud="false">“They’re here, they’re here, you
                            little wretches,” </said> I would have cried, <said who="governess"
                            aloud="false">“and you can’t deny it now!”</said>. <seg ana="repetition"

                        the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up.
                        The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night
                        when, <seg ana="vision-physical">looking out to see either <persName

                        it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual
                        inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, <seg
                            ana="sound-physical">I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once
                            a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might

                        while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the
                        monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself
                        that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by
                        pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive
                        delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself:

                            have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness

                        and <seg ana="touch-physical">I covered my face with my hands. </seg>

                            swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had
                            nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be

                        dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on
                        the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we
                        felt; and we had, all three, with <seg ana="repetition">repetition</seg>,
                        got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost
                        automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same
                        movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me
                        inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the
                        other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.
                            <said who="mrsgrose" aloud="true" toWhom="governess">“When do you think

                        </said> —there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for

                        </listPlace>; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any
                        moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less
                        encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the
                        doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our
                        finest exhibitions. <seg ana="writing letters">He never wrote to
                        them</seg>—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of
                        his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a
                        woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred
                        laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge
                        given not to appeal to him <seg ana="letters">when I let my charges
                            understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises.
                            They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them
                            all to this hour. </seg> This was a rule indeed which only added to the
                        satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any
                        moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more
                        awkward than anything else that might be for me. <seg
                            ana="vision-figurative">There appears to me, moreover, as I look back,
                        </seg> no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in
                        spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them.
                        Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn’t in these
                        days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been
                        postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived.
                        I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a
                        strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at
                        least change, and it came with a rush.</p>

                    <p>Walking to church a certain <date>Sunday</date>
                        <time>morning</time>, I had little <persName ref="miles">Miles</persName> at

                            >Mrs. Grose</persName>’s, well in sight. <seg ana="weather">It was a

                        accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be
                        particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little
                        charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society?
                        Something or other had brought nearer home to me <seg ana="touch-physical"

                        their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts
                        that were most abysmal. Turned out for <date>Sunday</date> by his uncle’s
                        tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his
                        grand little air, <persName ref="miles">Miles</persName>’s whole title to
                        independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him
                        that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say.
                        I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the
                        revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because <seg

                        the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe

                    <p>I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight
                        out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the
                        park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my
                        mind I would fly. The <date>Sunday</date> stillness both of the approaches
                        and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense
                        of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off
                        without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable,
                        however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle.
                        Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking
                        down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest
                        step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more

                            of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of

                        myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the
                        schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to
                        take. <seg ana="vision-physical">But I opened the door to find again, in a

                    <p>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my

                        housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who,
                        availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom <seg

                        There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her
                        hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took
                        this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her
                        attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its
                        announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She
                        rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy
                        of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there
                        as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; <seg

                                and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed

                        enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as
                        mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the
                        extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as
                        a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—<said

                            into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and

                        me, they made no allusion to my having failed them, and I was left, for the

                        would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the

                        brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at
                        heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest

                        all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little

                        been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was
                        now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.

                            down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had
                            breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with <persName

                        then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected,

                        permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer
                        relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of
                        one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too

                        highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything

                        had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of
                        his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; <seg

                        applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home
                        to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as

                        ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact
                        than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <emph rend="italics"
                            >all</emph> the nature. How could I put even a little of that article
                        into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other

                        plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had
                        come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably,
                            <seg ana="vision-figurative">by the quickened vision </seg> of what was

                        quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which
                        had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego
                        the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his
