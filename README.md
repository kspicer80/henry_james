# henry_james

A repository keeping track of some text analysis of Henry James's iconic _The Turn of the Screw_—including a [TEI version](https://tei-c.org/) of the novella.

Also playing around with the [booknlp library](https://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp) in addition to a bunch of other things.

Some scripts were created to help with TEI tagging certain entities utilized in the [spaCy NER class](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer)—I used this library to find all the words that could be tagged under TEI [<date>](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-date.html) and [<time>](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-time.html) tags; various other entities were tagged and found as well (the two instances of reference to the ["Sea of Azov,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Azov) for example).
