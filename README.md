# henry_james

A repository keeping track of some text analysis of Henry James's iconic _The Turn of the Screw_â€”including a [TEI version](https://tei-c.org/) of the novella.

Also playing around with the [booknlp library](https://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp) in addition to a bunch of other things.
