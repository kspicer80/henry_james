 in<br>an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no<br>comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case<br>he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case,<br>I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as<br>had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to<br>a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in<br>the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him<br>to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had<br>succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this<br>observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the<br>

—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call<br>attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which<br>I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself<br>something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in<br>fact till

; but that same evening, before we scattered,<br>he brought out what was in his mind.<br>“I quite agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that<br>its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a<br>particular touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its charming<br>kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the<br>effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to _two_ children—?”<br>“We say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns!<br>Also that we want to hear about them.”<br>I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to<br>present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in<br>his pockets. “Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too<br>horrible.” This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the<br>thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his<br>triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: “It’s<br>beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.”<br>“For sheer terror?” I remember asking.<br>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss<br>how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little<br>wincing grimace. “For dreadful—dreadfulness!”<br>“Oh, how delicious!” cried one of the women.<br>He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he<br>saw what he spoke of. “For general uncanny ugliness and horror and<br>pain.”<br>“Well then,” I said, “just sit right down and begin.”<br>He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an<br>instant. Then as he faced us again: “I can’t begin. I shall have to<br>send to town.” There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach;<br>after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. “The story’s<br>written. It’s in a locked drawer—it has not been out for

. I could<br>write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as<br>he finds it.” It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound<br>this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a<br>thickness of ice, the formation of many a

; had had his reasons<br>for a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just<br>his scruples that charmed me. I adjured him to write by the first post<br>and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the<br>experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt.<br>“Oh, thank God, no!”<br>“And is the record yours? You took the thing down?”<br>“Nothing but the impression. I took that _here_”—he tapped his heart.<br>“I’ve never lost it.”<br>“Then your manuscript—?”<br>“Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.” He hung fire<br>again. “A woman’s. She has been dead

. She sent me<br>the pages in question before she died.” They were all listening now,<br>and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the<br>inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also<br>without irritation. “She was a most charming person, but she was

 to think<br>she liked me, too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had<br>never told anyone. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew<br>she hadn’t. I was sure; I could see.

?” I inquired.<br>“Probably not till the second post.”<br>“Well then; after dinner—”<br>“You’ll all meet me here?” He looked us round again. “Isn’t anybody<br>going?” It was almost the tone of hope.<br>“Everybody will stay!”<br>“_I_ will”—and “_I_ will!” cried the ladies whose departure had been<br>fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more<br>light. “Who was it she was in love with?”<br>“The story will tell,” I took upon myself to reply.<br>“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”<br>“The story _won’t_ tell,” said Douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar<br>way.”<br>“More’s the pity, then. That’s the only way I ever understand.”<br>“Won’t _you_ tell, Douglas?” somebody else inquired.<br>He sprang to his feet again. “Yes—

.” And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly<br>bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on<br>the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. “Well, if I don’t know who she<br>was in love with, I know who _he_ was.”<br>“She was

;” and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of<br>it, we lost all attention for everything else. The last story, however<br>incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we<br>handshook and “candlestuck,” as somebody said, and went to bed.<br>I knew

, in<br>fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes<br>were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and<br>indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again<br>before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the<br>previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read<br>us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.<br>Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative,<br>from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall<br>presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death—when it was in<br>sight—committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of<br>

 and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to<br>read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The<br>departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank<br>heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a<br>rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with<br>which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final<br>auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to<br>a common thrill.<br>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up<br>the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in<br>possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of<br>several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at

on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to<br>London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had<br>already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This<br>person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in<br>Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective<br>patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a<br>figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a<br>fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily<br>fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and<br>pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as<br>gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the<br>courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as<br>a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She<br>conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a<br>glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming<br>ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled<br>with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to<br>his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her<br>immediately to proceed.<br>He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a<br>small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military<br>brother, whom he had lost

. These children were, by the<br>strangest of chances for a man in his position—a lone man without the<br>right sort of experience or a grain of patience—very heavily on his<br>hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a<br>series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had<br>done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house,<br>the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them<br>there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after<br>them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down<br>himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward<br>thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own<br>affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly,<br>which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their<br>little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, Mrs.<br>Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly<br>been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting<br>for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without<br>children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were<br>plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go<br>down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have,<br>in

 to<br>the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady<br>whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite<br>beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till her death, the great<br>awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school<br>for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and<br>things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a<br>cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old<br>gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.<br>So far had Douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.<br>“And what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?”<br>Our friend’s answer was prompt. “That will come out. I don’t<br>anticipate.”<br>“Excuse me—I thought that was just what you _are_ doing.”<br>“In her successor’s place,” I suggested, “I should have wished to learn<br>if the office brought with it—”<br>“Necessary danger to life?” Douglas completed my thought. “She did wish<br>to learn, and she did learn.

 what she learned.<br>Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was<br>young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little<br>company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated—took

 to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her<br>modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she<br>engaged.” And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of<br>the company, moved me to throw in—<br>“The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the<br>splendid young man. She succumbed to it.”<br>He got up and, as he had done

 before, went to the fire, gave<br>a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us.<br>“She saw him only twice.”<br>“Yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.”<br>A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. “It _was_<br>the beauty of it. There were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t<br>succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty—that for several<br>applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow,<br>simply afraid. It sounded dull—it sounded strange; and all the more so<br>because of his main condition.”<br>“Which was—?”<br>“That she should never trouble him—but never, never: neither appeal nor<br>complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself,<br>receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and<br>let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that<br>when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking<br>her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.”<br>“But was that all her reward?” one of the ladies asked.<br>“She never saw him again.”<br>“Oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again,<br>was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till,<br>

, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he<br>opened the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album.<br>The whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first<br>occasion the same lady put another question. “What is your title?”<br>“I haven’t one.”<br>“Oh, _I_ have!” I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to<br>read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the<br>beauty of his author’s hand.<br>#I<br>I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a<br>little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town,<br>to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found<br>myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this<br>state of mind I spent

, through a<br>country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly<br>welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue,<br>encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to<br>which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something<br>so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a<br>most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and<br>fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn<br>and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and<br>the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the<br>golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair<br>from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door,<br>with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent<br>a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I<br>had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that,<br>as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a<br>gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond<br>his promise.<br>I had no drop again till

 by my introduction to the younger of my<br>pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on<br>the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have<br>to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I<br>afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I<br>slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me,<br>too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the<br>liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of<br>the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the<br>full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time,<br>I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the<br>extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It<br>was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with<br>Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I<br>had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook<br>might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being<br>so glad to see me. I perceived within

 that she was so<br>glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively<br>on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little<br>why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with<br>suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.<br>But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection<br>with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the<br>vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to<br>do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times<br>rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and<br>prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint

, to look<br>at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to<br>listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter,<br>for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not<br>without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a<br>moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child;<br>there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as<br>at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies<br>were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the<br>light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent<br>matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, “form” little<br>Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It<br>had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I<br>should have her as a matter of course at

, her small white bed<br>being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken<br>was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time,<br>with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my<br>inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this<br>timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had<br>been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of<br>uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of<br>one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her,<br>and to determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It<br>was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I<br>could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with<br>four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib,<br>brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were<br>naturally things that in Flora’s presence could pass between us only as<br>prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.<br>“And the little boy—does he look like her? Is he too so very<br>remarkable?”<br>One wouldn’t flatter a child. “Oh, miss, _most_ remarkable. If you<br>think well of this one!”—and she stood there with a plate in her hand,<br>beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with<br>placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.<br>“Yes; if I do—?”<br>“You _will_ be carried away by the little gentleman!”<br>“Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I’m<br>afraid, however,” I remember feeling the impulse to add, “I’m rather<br>easily carried away. I was carried away in London!”<br>I can still see Mrs. Grose’s broad face as she took this in. “In Harley
Street?”<br>“In Harley Street.”<br>“Well, miss, you’re not the first—and you won’t be the last.”<br>“Oh, I’ve no pretension,” I could laugh, “to being the only one. My<br>other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back

, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under<br>care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.”<br>I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and<br>friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public<br>conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an<br>idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took her<br>manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank<br>heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was<br>glad I was there!<br>What I felt

 was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly<br>called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the<br>most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the<br>scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my<br>new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I<br>had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself,<br>freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this<br>agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first<br>duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into<br>the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I<br>arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she,<br>she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and<br>room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish<br>talk about it and with the result, in

, of our becoming<br>immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little<br>tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers<br>and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even<br>on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy,<br>her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than<br>she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since

 I<br>left it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would<br>now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with<br>her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners<br>and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance<br>inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for<br>diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and<br>fairytales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze<br>and adream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house,<br>embodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and<br>half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as<br>a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was,<br>strangely, at the helm!<br>#II<br>This came home to me when,

—it came late—contained a letter<br>for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be<br>composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself,<br>with a seal still unbroken. “This, I recognize, is from the headmaster,<br>and the headmaster’s an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him;<br>but mind you don’t report. Not a word.

, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me<br>that I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.<br>“What does it mean? The child’s dismissed his school.”<br>She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a<br>quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. “But aren’t they all—?”<br>“Sent home—yes. But only for

. Miles may never go back at<br>all.”<br>Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. “They won’t take him?”<br>“They absolutely decline.”<br>At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them<br>fill with good tears. “What has he done?”<br>I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter—which,<br>however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put<br>her hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. “Such things are not<br>for me, miss.”<br>My counselor couldn’t read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated<br>as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then,<br>faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my<br>pocket. “Is he really _bad_?”<br>The tears were still in her eyes. “Do the gentlemen say so?”<br>“They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it<br>should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.” Mrs.<br>Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this<br>meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some<br>coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went<br>on: “That he’s an injury to the others.”<br>At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly<br>flamed up. “Master Miles! _him_ an injury?”<br>There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet<br>seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the<br>idea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the<br>spot, sarcastically. “To his poor little innocent mates!”<br>“It’s too dreadful,” cried Mrs. Grose, “to say such cruel things! Why,<br>he’s scarce

.”<br>“Yes, yes; it would be incredible.”<br>She was evidently grateful for such a profession. “See him, miss,<br>first. _Then_ believe it!” I felt forthwith a new impatience to see<br>him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all

,<br>was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of<br>what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance.<br>“You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,” she added<br>the next moment—“_look_ at her!”<br>I turned and saw that Flora, whom,

She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment<br>from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish<br>light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had<br>conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should<br>follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of<br>Mrs. Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her<br>with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.<br>Nonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to<br>approach my colleague, especially as, toward

, I began to fancy<br>she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the<br>staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her,<br>holding her there with a hand on her arm. “I take what you said to me<br>at

 as a declaration that _you’ve_ never known him to be bad.”<br>She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very<br>honestly, adopted an attitude. “Oh, never known him—I don’t pretend<br>_that!_”<br>I was upset again. “Then you _have_ known him—?”<br>“Yes indeed, miss, thank God!”<br>On reflection I accepted this. “You mean that a boy who never is—?”<br>“Is no boy for _me!_”<br>I held her tighter. “You like them with the spirit to be naughty?”<br>Then, keeping pace with her answer, “So do I!” I eagerly brought out.<br>“But not to the degree to contaminate—”<br>“To contaminate?”—my big word left her at a loss. I explained it. “To<br>corrupt.”<br>She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh.<br>“Are you afraid he’ll corrupt _you?_” She put the question with such a<br>fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match<br>her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.<br>But

 for my drive approached, I cropped up in<br>another place. “What was the lady who was here before?”<br>“The last governess? She was also young and pretty—almost as young and<br>almost as pretty, miss, even as you.”<br>“Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!” I recollect<br>throwing off. “He seems to like us young and pretty!”<br>“Oh, he _did_,” Mrs. Grose assented: “it was the way he liked<br>everyone!” She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up.<br>“I mean that’s _his_ way—the master’s.”<br>I was struck. “But of whom did you speak first?”<br>She looked blank, but she colored. “Why, of _him_.”<br>“Of the master?”<br>“Of who else?”<br>There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my<br>impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I<br>merely asked what I wanted to know. “Did _she_ see anything in the<br>boy—?”<br>“That wasn’t right? She never told me.”<br>I had a scruple, but I overcame it. “Was she careful—particular?”<br>Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. “About some<br>things—yes.”<br>“But not about all?”<br>Again she considered. “Well, miss—she’s gone. I won’t tell tales.”<br>“I quite understand your feeling,” I hastened to reply; but I thought<br>it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: “Did<br>she die here?”<br>“No—she went off.”<br>I don’t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose’s that struck<br>me as ambiguous. “Went off to die?” Mrs. Grose looked straight out of<br>the window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what<br>young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. “She was taken ill,<br>you mean, and went home?”<br>“She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it,<br>at

,<br>to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We<br>had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good<br>girl and clever; and _she_ took the children altogether for the<br>interval. But our young lady never came back, and at the very moment I<br>was expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.”<br>I turned this over. “But of what?”<br>“He never told me! But please, miss,” said Mrs. Grose, “I must get to<br>my work.”<br>#III<br>Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just<br>preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual<br>esteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately<br>than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so<br>monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now<br>been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little late<br>on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me<br>before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that I<br>had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of<br>freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from<br>the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful,<br>and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of<br>passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I<br>then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I<br>have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable<br>little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been<br>impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence,<br>and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely<br>bewildered—so far, that is, as I was not outraged—by the sense of the<br>horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could<br>compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was<br>grotesque.<br>She promptly understood me. “You mean the cruel charge—?”<br>“It doesn’t live an instant. My dear woman, _look_ at him!”<br>She smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. “I assure<br>you, miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?” she immediately<br>added.<br>“In answer to the letter?” I had made up my mind. “Nothing.”<br>“And to his uncle?”<br>I was incisive. “Nothing.”<br>“And to the boy himself?”<br>I was wonderful. “Nothing.”<br>She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. “Then I’ll stand by<br>you. We’ll see it out.”<br>“We’ll see it out!” I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a<br>vow.<br>She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her<br>detached hand. “Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom—”<br>“To kiss me? No!” I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had<br>embraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.<br>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall<br>the way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a<br>little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I<br>accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was<br>under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the<br>far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on<br>a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my<br>ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could<br>deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of<br>beginning. I am unable even to remember at

, the lessons must have<br>been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that had<br>not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to<br>be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was<br>the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and<br>freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And<br>then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a<br>trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps<br>to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to<br>picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so<br>little trouble—they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to<br>speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough<br>future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise<br>them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had<br>been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood,<br>for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and<br>protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take<br>for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden<br>and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke<br>into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness—that hush in<br>which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the<br>spring of a beast.<br>In

 were long; they often, at their finest,<br>gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils,<br>teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final<br>retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,

 lingered and<br>the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the<br>old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a<br>sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity<br>of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself<br>tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my<br>discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was<br>giving pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose<br>pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly<br>hoped and directly asked of me, and that I _could_, after all, do it<br>proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied<br>myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the<br>faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be<br>remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently<br>gave their first sign.<br>It was plump,

, in the middle of my very hour: the<br>children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the<br>thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to<br>be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a<br>charming story suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear there at<br>the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I<br>didn’t ask more than that—I only asked that he should _know;_ and the<br>only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of<br>it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I<br>mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at

, I stopped short on emerging from one of the<br>plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the<br>spot—and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for—was<br>the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did<br>stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the<br>tower to which, on 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

, little Flora had conducted me.<br>This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated<br>structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see<br>little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends<br>of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a<br>measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too<br>pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic<br>revival that was already a respectable past. I admired them, had<br>fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially<br>when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual<br>battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had<br>so often invoked seemed most in place.<br>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two<br>distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first<br>and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of<br>the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I<br>had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of<br>vision of which, after

, there is no living view that I can<br>hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of<br>fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me<br>was—

 assured me—as little anyone else I knew as it<br>was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley<br>Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the<br>strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact<br>of its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my<br>statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the<br>whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what<br>I did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I<br>can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of<br>

 dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the<br>friendly hour lost, for

, all its voice. But there was no<br>other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with<br>a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in<br>the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as<br>definite as a picture in a frame. That’s how I thought, with<br>extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and<br>that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long<br>enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel,<br>as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants<br>more became intense.<br>The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard<br>to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well,<br>this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught<br>at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the<br>better, that I could see, in there having been in the house—and for how<br>long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I<br>just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there<br>should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this<br>visitant, at all events—and there was a touch of the strange freedom,<br>as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—seemed<br>to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny<br>through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too<br>far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at<br>shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have<br>been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of<br>the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me,<br>and with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I<br>form on this page; then, exactly, after 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

, as if to add to the<br>spectacle, he slowly changed his place—passed, looking at me hard all<br>the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the<br>sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me,<br>and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from<br>one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner,<br>but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He<br>turned away; that was all I knew.<br>#IV<br>It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was<br>rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly—a mystery<br>of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected<br>confinement? I can’t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a<br>confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my<br>collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had<br>quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and<br>driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three
miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this<br>mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular<br>part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I<br>became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes<br>back to me in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my<br>return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and<br>with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my<br>friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me<br>straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere<br>relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could<br>bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected<br>in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow<br>measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself<br>hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to<br>me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may<br>say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot,<br>accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a<br>reason that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward<br>resolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea<br>of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as<br>soon as possible to my room.<br>Here it was another affair; here, for

 after, it was a queer<br>affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there were<br>moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up<br>to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could<br>bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the<br>truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I<br>could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been<br>so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned.<br>It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry<br>and without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had<br>suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at

 and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not<br>been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any “game.”<br>Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was<br>but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. That<br>was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say<br>to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some<br>unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in<br>unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then<br>stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that<br>was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that<br>we should surely see no more of him.<br>This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that<br>what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my<br>charming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora,<br>and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could<br>throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was<br>a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my<br>original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the<br>probable gray prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it<br>appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that<br>presented itself as

 beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery<br>and the poetry of the schoolroom. I don’t mean by this, of course, that<br>we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise<br>the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that<br>except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel<br>for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!—I made constant<br>fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these<br>discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of<br>the boy’s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have<br>noted, to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be<br>nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had cleared it<br>up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there<br>with the real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and<br>fair for the little horrid, unclean school-world, and he had paid a<br>price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences,<br>such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the<br>majority—which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters—turn<br>infallibly to the vindictive.<br>Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it<br>never made Miles a muff) that kept them—how shall I express it?—almost<br>impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs<br>of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to whack! I<br>remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were,<br>no history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in<br>this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet<br>extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I<br>have seen, struck me as beginning anew

second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really<br>been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have “caught” it, and I<br>should have caught it by the rebound—I should have found the trace. I<br>found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of<br>his school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part,<br>was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under<br>the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I<br>perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to<br>any pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in

, by exception, in<br>that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up” dining<br>room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover<br>them.

 light still lingered,<br>and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on<br>a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but<br>to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking<br>straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was<br>instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the<br>person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I<br>won’t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a<br>nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made<br>me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same—he was<br>the same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the<br>waist up, the window, though the dining room was on the ground floor,<br>not going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to<br>the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to<br>show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few

—long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it<br>was as if I had been looking at him for

 and had known him always.<br>Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before;<br>his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as<br>deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I<br>could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On<br>the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was<br>not for me he had come there. He had come for someone else.<br>The flash of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of<br>dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood<br>there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I<br>was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the<br>door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the<br>drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a<br>corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my<br>visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief<br>of this; but I took in the whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I<br>call it time, but how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose

<br>of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left<br>me: they couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last.<br>The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all<br>I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were<br>shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt<br>that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not<br>there if I didn’t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively,<br>instead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was<br>confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had<br>stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had<br>looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what<br>his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before,<br>came in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition<br>of what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;<br>she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock<br>that I had received. She turned white, and this made me ask myself if I<br>had blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just _my_<br>lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that<br>I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited<br>I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to<br>mention. I wondered why _she_ should be scared.<br>#V<br>Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she<br>loomed again into view. “What in the name of goodness is the matter—?”<br>She was now flushed and out of breath.<br>I said nothing till she came quite near. “With me?” I must have made a<br>wonderful face. “Do I show it?”<br>“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”<br>I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My<br>need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose’s had dropped, without a<br>rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not<br>with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held<br>her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of<br>support in the shy heave of her surprise. “You came for me for church,<br>of course, but I can’t go.”<br>“Has anything happened?”<br>“Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?”<br>“Through this window? Dreadful!”<br>“Well,” I said, “I’ve been frightened.” Mrs. Grose’s eyes expressed<br>plainly that _she_ had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well<br>her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience.<br>Oh, it was quite settled that she _must_ share! “Just what you saw from<br>the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What _I_ saw—just<br>before—was much worse.”<br>Her hand tightened. “What was it?”<br>“An extraordinary man. Looking in.”<br>“What extraordinary man?”<br>“I haven’t the least idea.”<br>Mrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. “Then where is he gone?”<br>“I know still less.”<br>“Have you seen him before?”<br>“Yes—once. On the old tower.”<br>She could only look at me harder. “Do you mean he’s a stranger?”<br>“Oh, very much!”<br>“Yet you didn’t tell me?”<br>“No—for reasons. But now that you’ve guessed—”<br>Mrs. Grose’s round eyes encountered this charge. “Ah, I haven’t<br>guessed!” she said very simply. “How can I if _you_ don’t imagine?”<br>“I don’t in the very least.”<br>“You’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?”<br>“And on this spot just now.”<br>Mrs. Grose looked round again. “What was he doing on the tower?”<br>“Only standing there and looking down at me.”<br>She thought a minute. “Was he a gentleman?”<br>I found I had no need to think. “No.” She gazed in deeper wonder. “No.”<br>“Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?”<br>“Nobody—nobody. I didn’t tell you, but I made sure.”<br>She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It<br>only went indeed a little way. “But if he isn’t a gentleman—”<br>“What _is_ he? He’s a horror.”<br>“A horror?”<br>“He’s—God help me if I know _what_ he is!”<br>Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier<br>distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt<br>inconsequence. “It’s time we should be at church.”<br>“Oh, I’m not fit for church!”<br>“Won’t it do you good?”<br>“It won’t do _them!_— I nodded at the house.<br>“The children?”<br>“I can’t leave them now.”<br>“You’re afraid—?”<br>I spoke boldly. “I’m afraid of _him_.”<br>Mrs. Grose’s large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the<br>faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out<br>in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that<br>was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought<br>instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to<br>be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. “When<br>was it—on the tower?”<br>“About

.”<br>“Almost at dark,” said Mrs. Grose.<br>“Oh, no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.”<br>“Then how did he get in?”<br>“And how did he get out?” I laughed. “I had no opportunity to ask him!<br>

, you see,” I pursued, “he has not been able to get in.”<br>“He only peeps?”<br>“I hope it will be confined to that!” She had now let go my hand; she<br>turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: “Go to<br>church. Goodbye. I must watch.”<br>Slowly she faced me again. “Do you fear for them?”<br>We met in another long look. “Don’t _you?_” Instead of answering she<br>came nearer to the window and, for

, applied her face to the<br>glass. “You see how he could see,” I meanwhile went on.<br>She didn’t move. “How long was he here?”<br>“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”<br>Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face.<br>“_I_ couldn’t have come out.”<br>“Neither could I!” I laughed again. “But I did come. I have my duty.”<br>“So have I mine,” she replied; after which she added: “What is he<br>like?”<br>“I’ve been dying to tell you. But he’s like nobody.”<br>“Nobody?” she echoed.<br>“He has no hat.” Then seeing in her face that she already, in this,<br>with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke<br>to stroke. “He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face,<br>long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer<br>whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow,<br>darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good<br>deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know clearly that<br>they’re rather small and very fixed. His mouth’s wide, and his lips are<br>thin, and except for his little whiskers he’s quite clean-shaven. He<br>gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.”<br>“An actor!” It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs.<br>Grose at that moment.<br>“I’ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He’s tall, active, erect,”<br>I continued, “but never—no, never!—a gentleman.”<br>My companion’s face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started<br>and her mild mouth gaped. “A gentleman?” she gasped, confounded,<br>stupefied: “a gentleman _he?_”<br>“You know him then?”<br>She visibly tried to hold herself. “But he _is_ handsome?”<br>I saw the way to help her. “Remarkably!”<br>“And dressed—?”<br>“In somebody’s clothes.” “They’re smart, but they’re not his own.”<br>She broke into a breathless affirmative groan: “They’re the master’s!”<br>I caught it up. “You _do_ know him?”<br>She faltered but a second. “Quint!” she cried.<br>“Quint?”<br>“Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!”<br>“When the master was?”<br>Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. “He never<br>wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed. They<br>were both here—

. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.”<br>I followed, but halting a little. “Alone?”<br>“Alone with _us_.” Then, as from a deeper depth, “In charge,” she<br>added.<br>“And what became of him?”<br>She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. “He went, too,”<br>she brought out at last.<br>“Went where?”<br>Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. “God knows where! He<br>died.”<br>“Died?” I almost shrieked.<br>She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter<br>the wonder of it. “Yes. Mr. Quint is dead.”<br>#VI<br>It took of course more than that particular passage to place us<br>together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my<br>dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified,<br>and my companion’s knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation<br>and half compassion—of that liability. There had been,

, so prostrate—there had been,<br>for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of<br>tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of<br>mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our<br>retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there<br>to have everything out. The result of our having everything out was<br>simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She<br>herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the<br>house but the governess was in the governess’s plight; yet she accepted<br>without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and<br>ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an<br>expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of<br>which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of<br>human charities.<br>What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we<br>thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in<br>spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I<br>knew at

, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable<br>of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly<br>sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so<br>compromising a contract. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as<br>the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see<br>how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good<br>fortune, _could_ steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that<br>led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I<br>could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could<br>join me. Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to<br>me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every<br>feature of what I had seen.<br>“He was looking for someone else, you say—someone who was not you?”<br>“He was looking for little Miles.” A portentous clearness now possessed<br>me. “_That’s_ whom he was looking for.”<br>“But how do you know?”<br>“I know, I know, I know!” My exaltation grew. “And _you_ know, my<br>dear!”<br>She didn’t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling<br>as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: “What if _he_ should see<br>him?”<br>“Little Miles? That’s what he wants!”<br>She looked immensely scared again. “The child?”<br>“Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to _them_.” That he might<br>was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay;<br>which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in<br>practically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see<br>again what I had already seen, but something within me said that by<br>offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by<br>accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an<br>expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The<br>children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I<br>recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.<br>“It does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned—”<br>She looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up. “His having been here<br>and the time they were with him?”<br>“The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history,<br>in any way.”<br>“Oh, the little lady doesn’t remember. She never heard or knew.”<br>“The circumstances of his death?” I thought with some intensity.<br>“Perhaps not. But Miles would remember—Miles would know.”<br>“Ah, don’t try him!” broke from Mrs. Grose.<br>I returned her the look she had given me. “Don’t be afraid.” I<br>continued to think. “It _is_ rather odd.”<br>“That he has never spoken of him?”<br>“Never by the least allusion. And you tell me they were ‘great<br>friends’?”<br>“Oh, it wasn’t _him!_” Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. “It was<br>Quint’s own fancy. To play with him, I mean—to spoil him.” She paused a<br>moment; then she added: “Quint was much too free.”<br>This gave me, straight from my vision of his face—_such_ a face!—a<br>sudden sickness of disgust. “Too free with _my_ boy?”<br>“Too free with everyone!”<br>I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by<br>the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of<br>the household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our<br>small colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the<br>lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions,<br>had ever, within anyone’s memory attached to the kind old place. It had<br>neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only<br>desired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the<br>very last thing of all, to the test. It was when, at

, she had<br>her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave. “I have it from you<br>then—for it’s of great importance—that he was definitely and admittedly<br>bad?”<br>“Oh, not admittedly. _I_ knew it—but the master didn’t.”<br>“And you never told him?”<br>“Well, he didn’t like tale-bearing—he hated complaints. He was terribly<br>short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to<br>_him_—”<br>“He wouldn’t be bothered with more?” This squared well enough with my<br>impressions of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very<br>particular perhaps about some of the company _he_ kept. All the same, I<br>pressed my interlocutress. “I promise you _I_ would have told!”<br>She felt my discrimination. “I daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was<br>afraid.”<br>“Afraid of what?”<br>“Of things that man could do. Quint was so clever—he was so deep.”<br>I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. “You weren’t afraid<br>of anything else? Not of his effect—?”<br>“His effect?” she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I<br>faltered.<br>“On innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.”<br>“No, they were not in mine!” she roundly and distressfully returned.<br>“The master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed<br>not to be well and the country air so good for him. So he had<br>everything to say. Yes”—she let me have it—“even about _them_.”<br>“Them—that creature?” I had to smother a kind of howl. “And you could<br>bear it!”<br>“No. I couldn’t—and I can’t now!” And the poor woman burst into tears.<br>A rigid control, from

, that this was<br>not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were<br>fears.

, Peter Quint was found, by a laborer<br>going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a<br>catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound to his<br>head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final<br>evidence, _had_ been—by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the<br>public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at<br>the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night<br>and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after the<br>inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been<br>matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders,<br>vices more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal<br>more.<br>I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible<br>picture of my state of mind; but I was in

 literally able to<br>find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded<br>of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and<br>difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen—oh, in<br>the right quarter!—that I could succeed where many another girl might<br>have failed. It was an immense help to me—I confess I rather applaud<br>myself as I look back!—that I saw my service so strongly and so simply.<br>I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the<br>most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness<br>had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s<br>own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united<br>in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I—well, I had _them_. It<br>was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me<br>in an image richly material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them.<br>The more I saw, the less they would. I began to watch them in a stifled<br>suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too<br>long, have turned to something like madness. What saved me, as I now<br>see, was that it turned to something else altogether. It didn’t last as<br>suspense—it was superseded by horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes—from<br>the moment I really took hold.<br>This moment dated from

 that I happened to spend in<br>the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles<br>indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to<br>finish a book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable<br>in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the<br>restless.

, seeking the shade, for the sun was<br>still high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with<br>her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived—it was the<br>charming thing in both children—to let me alone without appearing to<br>drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were<br>never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all<br>really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this<br>was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as<br>an active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention—they had no<br>occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only<br>with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of<br>the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my<br>exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what<br>I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something<br>very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We<br>were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography,<br>the lake was the Sea of Azof.<br>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other<br>side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this<br>knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world—the<br>strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly<br>merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was something<br>or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked the<br>pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet<br>without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person.<br>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade,<br>but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour.<br>There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the<br>conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what<br>I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of<br>raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching<br>in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort<br>not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to<br>make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure<br>whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I<br>recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself<br>that nothing was more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one<br>of the men about the place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a<br>tradesman’s boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect<br>on my practical certitude as I was conscious—still even without<br>looking—of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor.<br>Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other<br>things that they absolutely were not.<br>Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as<br>soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right<br>second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I<br>transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was<br>about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the<br>wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held<br>my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden<br>innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited,<br>but nothing came; then, in the first place—and there is something more<br>dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate—I was<br>determined by a sense that, within

, she had, in her play, turned her back to the water.<br>This was her attitude when I at last looked at her—looked with the<br>confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct<br>personal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which<br>happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to<br>her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a<br>mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, as I watched her,<br>she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place.<br>My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after

 I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes—I<br>faced what I had to face.<br>#VII<br>I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give<br>no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still<br>hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: “They<br>_know_—it’s too monstrous: they know, they know!”<br>“And what on earth—?” I felt her incredulity as she held me.<br>“Why, all that _we_ know—and heaven knows what else besides!” Then, as<br>she released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now<br>with full coherency even to myself. “

, in the garden”—I<br>could scarce articulate—“Flora _saw!_”<br>Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. “She<br>has told you?” she panted.<br>“Not a word—that’s the horror.

; and in the midst of it she came.”<br>“Came how—from where?”<br>“From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there—but not<br>so near.”<br>“And without coming nearer?”<br>“Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as<br>you!”<br>My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. “Was she someone<br>you’ve never seen?”<br>“Yes. But someone the child has. Someone _you_ have.” Then, to show how<br>I had thought it all out: “My predecessor—the one who died.”<br>“Miss Jessel?”<br>“Miss Jessel. You don’t believe me?” I pressed.<br>She turned right and left in her distress. “How can you be sure?”<br>This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.<br>“Then ask Flora—_she’s_ sure!” But I had no sooner spoken than I caught<br>myself up. “No, for God’s sake, _don’t!_ She’ll say she isn’t—she’ll<br>lie!”<br>Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. “Ah, how<br>_can_ you?”<br>“Because I’m clear. Flora doesn’t want me to know.”<br>“It’s only then to spare you.”<br>“No, no—there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see<br>in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don’t know what I<br>_don’t_ see—what I _don’t_ fear!”<br>Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. “You mean you’re afraid of seeing<br>her again?”<br>“Oh, no; that’s nothing—now!” Then I explained. “It’s of _not_ seeing<br>her.”<br>But my companion only looked wan. “I don’t understand you.”<br>“Why, it’s that the child may keep it up—and that the child assuredly<br>_will_—without my knowing it.”<br>At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet<br>presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force<br>of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to<br>give way to. “Dear, dear—we must keep our heads! And after all, if she<br>doesn’t mind it—!” She even tried a grim joke. “Perhaps she likes it!”<br>“Likes _such_ things—a scrap of an infant!”<br>“Isn’t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?” my friend bravely<br>inquired.<br>She brought me, for the instant, almost round. “Oh, we must clutch at<br>_that_—we must cling to it! If it isn’t a proof of what you say, it’s a<br>proof of—God knows what! For the woman’s a horror of horrors.”<br>Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes

 on the ground; then at<br>last raising them, “Tell me how you know,” she said.<br>“Then you admit it’s what she was?” I cried.<br>“Tell me how you know,” my friend simply repeated.<br>“Know? By seeing her! By the way she looked.”<br>“At you, do you mean—so wickedly?”<br>“Dear me, no—I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She<br>only fixed the child.”<br>Mrs. Grose tried to see it. “Fixed her?”<br>“Ah, with such awful eyes!”<br>She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. “Do you<br>mean of dislike?”<br>“God help us, no. Of something much worse.”<br>“Worse than dislike?”—this left her indeed at a loss.<br>“With a determination—indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.”<br>I made her turn pale. “Intention?”<br>“To get hold of her.” Mrs. Grose—her eyes just lingering on mine—gave a<br>shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out<br>I completed my statement. “_That’s_ what Flora knows.”<br>After a little she turned round. “The person was in black, you say?”<br>“In mourning—rather poor, almost shabby. But—yes—with extraordinary<br>beauty.” I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke,<br>brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed<br>this. “Oh, handsome—very, very,” I insisted; “wonderfully handsome. But<br>infamous.”<br>She slowly came back to me. “Miss Jessel—_was_ infamous.” She once more<br>took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me<br>against the increase of alarm I might draw from this disclosure. “They<br>were both infamous,” she finally said.<br>So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found<br>absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. “I<br>appreciate,” I said, “the great decency of your not having hitherto<br>spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.”<br>She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which<br>I went on: “I must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was<br>something between them.”<br>“There was everything.”<br>“In spite of the difference—?”<br>“Oh, of their rank, their condition”—she brought it woefully out.<br>“_She_ was a lady.”<br>I turned it over; I again saw. “Yes—she was a lady.”<br>“And he so dreadfully below,” said Mrs. Grose.<br>I felt that I doubtless needn’t press too hard, in such company, on the<br>place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an<br>acceptance of my companion’s own measure of my predecessor’s abasement.<br>There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for my<br>full vision—on the evidence—of our employer’s late clever, good-looking<br>“own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. “The fellow was a<br>hound.”<br>Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense<br>of shades. “I’ve never seen one like him. He did what he wished.”<br>“With _her?_”<br>“With them all.”<br>It was as if now in my friend’s own eyes Miss Jessel had again<br>appeared. I seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation<br>of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out<br>with decision: “It must have been also what _she_ wished!”<br>Mrs. Grose’s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at<br>the same time: “Poor woman—she paid for it!”<br>“Then you do know what she died of?” I asked.<br>“No—I know nothing. I wanted not to know; I was glad enough I didn’t;<br>and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!”<br>“Yet you had, then, your idea—”<br>“Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes—as to that. She couldn’t have<br>stayed. Fancy it here—for a governess! And afterward I imagined—and I<br>still imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.”<br>“Not so dreadful as what _I_ do,” I replied; on which I must have shown<br>her—as I was indeed but too conscious—a front of miserable defeat. It<br>brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch<br>of her kindness my power to resist broke down. I burst, as I had, the<br>other time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly<br>breast, and my lamentation overflowed. “I don’t do it!” I sobbed in<br>despair; “I don’t save or shield them! It’s far worse than I<br>dreamed—they’re lost!”<br>#VIII<br>What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter<br>I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution<br>to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of<br>a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We<br>were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed<br>as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was<br>least to be questioned.

, while the house slept, we had<br>another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its<br>being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her<br>perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I<br>had “made it up,” I came to be able to give, of each of the persons<br>appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their<br>special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly<br>recognized and named them. She wished of course—small blame to her!—to<br>sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own<br>interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way<br>to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability<br>that with recurrence—for recurrence we took for granted—I should get<br>used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had<br>suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion<br>that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication

 had brought a little ease.<br>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my<br>pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of<br>their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively<br>cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other<br>words, plunged afresh into Flora’s special society and there become<br>aware—it was almost a luxury!—that she could put her little conscious<br>hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet<br>speculation and then had accused me to my face of having “cried.” I had<br>supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for<br>the time, at all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that<br>they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of<br>the child’s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature<br>cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I<br>naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my<br>agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat<br>to Mrs. Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small

—that<br>with their voices in the air, their pressure on one’s heart, and their<br>fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell to the ground but<br>their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to<br>settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of<br>subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my<br>show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate<br>the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as<br>a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a<br>matter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have<br>had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion,<br>so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I<br>actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much<br>as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same<br>time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I<br>myself did!

from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by<br>bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong<br>side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat;<br>and I remember how on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the<br>concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt<br>the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. “I don’t believe<br>anything so horrible,” I recollect saying; “no, let us put it<br>definitely, my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know, there’s a<br>thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit<br>more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you.

 that I myself have lived with him and<br>so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of<br>delightful, lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made<br>the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to<br>take.

What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the<br>purpose. It was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a<br>period of

 Quint and the boy had been perpetually<br>together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had<br>ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so<br>close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank<br>overture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,<br>requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,<br>directly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I<br>pressed, was that _she_ liked to see young gentlemen not forget their<br>station.<br>I pressed again, of course, at this. “You reminded him that Quint was<br>only a base menial?”<br>“As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.”<br>“And for another thing?” I waited. “He repeated your words to Quint?”<br>“No, not that. It’s just what he _wouldn’t!_” she could still impress<br>upon me. “I was sure, at any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t. But he<br>denied certain occasions.”<br>“What occasions?”<br>“When they had been about together quite as if Quint were his tutor—and<br>a very grand one—and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had<br>gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent

 with him.”<br>“He then prevaricated about it—he said he hadn’t?” Her assent was clear<br>enough to cause me to add in a moment: “I see. He lied.”<br>“Oh!” Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn’t matter;<br>which indeed she backed up by a further remark. “You see, after all,<br>Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She didn’t forbid him.”<br>I considered. “Did he put that to you as a justification?”<br>At this she dropped again. “No, he never spoke of it.”<br>“Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?”<br>She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. “Well, he didn’t<br>show anything. He denied,” she repeated; “he denied.”<br>Lord, how I pressed her now! “So that you could see he knew what was<br>between the two wretches?”<br>“I don’t know—I don’t know!” the poor woman groaned.<br>“You do know, you dear thing,” I replied; “only you haven’t my dreadful<br>boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and<br>delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without<br>my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable.<br>But I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in the boy that<br>suggested to you,” I continued, “that he covered and concealed their<br>relation.”<br>“Oh, he couldn’t prevent—”<br>“Your learning the truth? I daresay! But, heavens,” I fell, with<br>vehemence, athinking, “what it shows that they must, to that extent,<br>have succeeded in making of him!”<br>“Ah, nothing that’s not nice _now!_” Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.<br>“I don’t wonder you looked queer,” I persisted, “when I mentioned to<br>you the letter from his school!”<br>“I doubt if I looked as queer as you!” she retorted with homely force.<br>“And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel<br>now?”<br>“Yes, indeed—and if he was a fiend at school!

. Only, put it to me again!” I cried in a<br>way that made my friend stare. “There are directions in which I must<br>not for the present let myself go.” Meanwhile I returned to her first<br>example—the one to which she had just previously referred—of the boy’s<br>happy capacity for an occasional slip. “If Quint—on your remonstrance<br>at the time you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things Miles<br>said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.” Again<br>her admission was so adequate that I continued: “And you forgave him<br>that?”<br>“Wouldn’t _you?_”<br>“Oh, yes!” And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the<br>oddest amusement. Then I went on: “At all events, while he was with the<br>man—”<br>“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!”<br>It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it<br>suited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of<br>forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the<br>expression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light<br>on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to<br>Mrs. Grose. “His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less<br>engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in<br>him of the little natural man. Still,” I mused, “They must do, for they<br>make me feel more than ever that I must watch.”<br>It made me blush,

, to see in my friend’s face how much<br>more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as<br>presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came out<br>when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. “Surely you don’t accuse<br>_him_—”<br>“Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember<br>that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.” Then, before<br>shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, “I must<br>just wait,” I wound up.<br>#IX<br>I waited and waited, and

, as they elapsed, took something from<br>my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant<br>sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to<br>grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the<br>sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish<br>grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if<br>I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would<br>yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to<br>struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however,<br>a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I<br>used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought<br>strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only<br>made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping<br>them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they _were_ so<br>immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events,<br>as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could<br>only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for<br>taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I<br>found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as<br>I had done so I used to say to myself: “What will they think of that?<br>Doesn’t it betray too much?” It would have been easy to get into a sad,<br>wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I<br>feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the<br>immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even<br>under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it<br>occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little<br>outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering<br>if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own<br>demonstrations.<br>They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me;<br>which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response<br>in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they<br>were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if<br>I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a<br>purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for<br>their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons better and<br>better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of<br>diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling<br>her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as<br>animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the<br>“pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite.<br>I should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of<br>the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private<br>correction, with which, in

, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude<br>to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles.<br>What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the<br>question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his<br>perpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad<br>governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not<br>the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the<br>impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was<br>under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a<br>tremendous incitement.<br>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone<br>school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been<br>“kicked out” by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me<br>add that in their company now—and I was careful almost never to be out<br>of it—I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music<br>and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each<br>of the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a<br>marvelous knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano broke<br>into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were<br>confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in<br>the highest spirits in order to “come in” as something new. I had had<br>brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could<br>be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that<br>there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior<br>age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were<br>extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or<br>complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of<br>sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps<br>came across traces of little understandings between them by which one
of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is<br>a _naïf_ side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced<br>upon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the<br>other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.<br>I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on<br>with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the<br>most liberal faith—for which I little care; but—and this is another<br>matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it<br>to the end. There came suddenly

—with nothing to lead up or to prepare<br>it—I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the<br>night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned,<br>I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent<br>sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a<br>couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—

<br>fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated<br>renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached<br>the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my<br>youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding’s<br>_Amelia_; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general<br>conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to<br>looking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping,<br>in the fashion of

, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded,<br>as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. I<br>recollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I<br>found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered,<br>looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. There was<br>a moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had<br>had, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the<br>house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the<br>half-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must<br>have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down<br>my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of<br>the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little<br>impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.<br>I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went<br>straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within<br>sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the<br>staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three<br>things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of<br>succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I<br>perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of

 rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw<br>that there was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I<br>required no lapse of

 to stiffen myself for a third encounter<br>with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was<br>therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it<br>stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower<br>and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the<br>cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on<br>the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common<br>intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,<br>dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve<br>this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that<br>dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me<br>there that didn’t meet and measure him.<br>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had,<br>thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end<br>of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of<br>confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the<br>time, at least—to have him to reckon with; and during

, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some<br>criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close<br>quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of<br>the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at

, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed,<br>in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved.<br>The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to<br>make me doubt if even _I_ were in life. I can’t express what followed<br>it save by saying that the silence itself—which was indeed in a manner<br>an attestation of my strength—became the element into which I saw the<br>figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have<br>seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an<br>order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch<br>could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the<br>darkness in which the next bend was lost.<br>#X<br>I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect<br>presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone:<br>then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light<br>of the candle I had left burning was that Flora’s little bed was empty;<br>and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that,

, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had<br>left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the<br>sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled<br>forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering<br>sound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child,<br>ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there<br>in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink<br>bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave,<br>and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the<br>thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness<br>that she addressed me with a reproach. “You naughty: where _have_ you<br>been?”—instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself<br>arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with<br>the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay<br>there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had<br>become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back<br>into my chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had<br>pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given<br>herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful<br>little face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing my<br>eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of<br>something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. “You were<br>looking for me out of the window?” I said. “You thought I might be<br>walking in the grounds?”<br>“Well, you know, I thought someone was”—she never blanched as she<br>smiled out that at me.<br>Oh, how I looked at her now! “And did you see anyone?”<br>“Ah, _no!_” she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish<br>inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her little<br>drawl of the negative.<br>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she<br>lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the<br>three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One of<br>these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to<br>withstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that,<br>wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why<br>not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her<br>straight in her lovely little lighted face? “You see, you see, you<br>_know_ that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it;<br>therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least<br>live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our<br>fate, where we are and what it means?” This solicitation dropped, alas,<br>as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have<br>spared myself—well, you’ll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang<br>again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way.<br>“Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were<br>still there?”<br>Flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile:<br>“Because I don’t like to frighten you!”<br>“But if I had, by your idea, gone out—?”<br>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame<br>of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as<br>impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. “Oh, but you know,” she<br>quite adequately answered, “that you might come back, you dear, and<br>that you _have!_” And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had,<br>for a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove<br>that I recognized the pertinence of my return.<br>You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

.<br>I repeatedly sat up till I didn’t know when; I selected moments when my<br>roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in<br>the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met Quint.<br>But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I<br>on no other occasion saw him in the house. I just missed, on the<br>staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. Looking down it<br>from the top I once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of<br>the lower steps with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and<br>her head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands. I had been there but an<br>instant, however, when she vanished without looking round at me. I<br>knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I<br>wondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should<br>have had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well,<br>there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night<br>after my latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered<br>now—I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the<br>particular quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest<br>shock. It was precisely the first night during this series that, weary<br>with watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself<br>down at 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till<br>about one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as<br>completely roused as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light<br>burning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that Flora
had extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in the<br>darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the<br>window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed<br>the picture.<br>The child had again got up—this time blowing out the taper, and had<br>again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind<br>the blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw—as she<br>had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time—was proved to me by<br>the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the<br>haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden, protected,<br>absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened<br>forward—and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her,<br>and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face<br>with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate<br>with it as she had not then been able to do. What I, on my side, had to<br>care for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some<br>other window in

. I got to the door without her hearing<br>me; I got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for<br>some sound from her. While I stood in the passage I had my eyes on her<br>brother’s door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably,<br>produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of<br>as my temptation. What if I should go straight in and march to _his_<br>window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of<br>my motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long<br>halter of my boldness?<br>This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and<br>pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might<br>portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were<br>secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which<br>my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was<br>hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds—a figure<br>prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it<br>was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated afresh, but<br>on other grounds and only for

; then I had made my choice.<br>There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing<br>the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the<br>lower one—though high above the gardens—in the solid corner of the<br>house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square<br>chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of<br>which made it so inconvenient that it had not for

, though kept by<br>Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it<br>and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the<br>first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as<br>quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I<br>uncovered the glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane,<br>was able, the darkness without being much less than within, to see that<br>I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon<br>made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a<br>person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if<br>fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not so<br>much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. There<br>was clearly another person above me—there was a person on the tower;<br>but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived<br>and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I felt<br>sick as I made it out—was poor little Miles himself.<br>#XI<br>It was not till

 that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor<br>with which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet<br>her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not<br>provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the<br>children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of<br>mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere<br>smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others<br>my horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if<br>she hadn’t I don’t know what would have become of me, for I couldn’t<br>have borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to<br>the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our<br>little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness<br>and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my<br>trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she<br>would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match<br>them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed<br>them, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all<br>her look, thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces<br>would still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a<br>steady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the<br>development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public<br>accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves,<br>she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by<br>their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I<br>could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it<br>would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find<br>myself anxious about hers.<br>At

 I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the<br>terrace, where, with the lapse of

, the afternoon sun was now<br>agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance,<br>but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one<br>of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us,<br>over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook<br>and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs.<br>Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the<br>suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to<br>take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a<br>receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my<br>superiority—my accomplishments and my function—in her patience under my<br>pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a<br>witch’s broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a<br>large clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the<br>time that, in my recital of the events of

, I reached the<br>point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a<br>monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I<br>had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a<br>concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a<br>signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my<br>small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my<br>sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after<br>I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate<br>challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he<br>had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand<br>without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase<br>where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I<br>had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.<br>Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered—oh,<br>_how_ I had wondered!—if he were groping about in his little mind for<br>something plausible and not too grotesque. It would tax his invention,<br>certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a<br>curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He<br>couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get<br>out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this<br>question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce _I_ should. I was<br>confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now<br>to sounding my own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed<br>into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and<br>the window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that<br>there was no need of striking a match—I remember how I suddenly<br>dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that<br>he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He could do what he<br>liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should<br>continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those<br>caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He<br>“had” me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me,<br>who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor<br>of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect<br>intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to<br>convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to<br>suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly<br>shook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful;<br>never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such<br>tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held<br>him there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form at least,<br>to put it to him.<br>“You must tell me now—and all the truth. What did you go out for? What<br>were you doing there?”<br>I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes,<br>and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. “If I<br>tell you why, will you understand?” My heart, at this, leaped into my<br>mouth. _Would_ he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press it,<br>and I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod.<br>He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood<br>there more than ever a little fairy prince. It was his brightness<br>indeed that gave me a respite. Would it be so great if he were really<br>going to tell me? “Well,” he said at last, “just exactly in order that<br>you should do this.”<br>“Do what?”<br>“Think me—for a change—_bad!_” I shall never forget the sweetness and<br>gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he<br>bent forward and kissed me. It was practically the end of everything. I<br>met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for

 in my<br>arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly the<br>account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it<br>was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I<br>presently glanced about the room, I could say—<br>“Then you didn’t undress at all?”<br>He fairly glittered in the gloom. “Not at all. I sat up and read.”<br>“And when did you go down?”<br>“At

. When I’m bad I _am_ bad!”<br>“I see, I see—it’s charming. But how could you be sure I would know<br>it?”<br>“Oh, I arranged that with Flora.” His answers rang out with a<br>readiness! “She was to get up and look out.”<br>“Which is what she did do.” It was I who fell into the trap!<br>“So she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also<br>looked—you saw.”<br>“While you,” I concurred, “caught your death in the night air!”<br>He literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford<br>radiantly to assent. “How otherwise should I have been bad enough?” he<br>asked. Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview<br>closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his<br>joke, he had been able to draw upon.<br>#XII<br>The particular impression I had received proved in the

 light, I<br>repeat, not quite successfully presentable to Mrs. Grose, though I<br>reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made<br>before we separated. “It all lies in half a dozen words,” I said to<br>her, “words that really settle the matter. ‘Think, you know, what I<br>_might_ do!’ He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down<br>to the ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he gave them a taste of<br>at school.”<br>“Lord, you do change!” cried my friend.<br>“I don’t change—I simply make it out.

 you had been with<br>either child, you would clearly have understood. The more I’ve watched<br>and waited the more I’ve felt that if there were nothing else to make<br>it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. _Never_,<br>by a slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of<br>their old friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his expulsion.<br>Oh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us<br>there to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their<br>fairytale they’re steeped in their vision of the dead restored. He’s<br>not reading to her,” I declared; “they’re talking of _them_—they’re<br>talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it’s a wonder<br>I’m not. What I’ve seen would have made _you_ so; but it has only made<br>me more lucid, made me get hold of still other things.”<br>My lucidity must have seemed awful, but the charming creatures who were<br>victims of it, passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness,<br>gave my colleague something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she<br>held as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she covered them<br>still with her eyes. “Of what other things have you got hold?”<br>“Why, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at<br>bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their<br>more than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It’s a<br>game,” I went on; “it’s a policy and a fraud!”<br>“On the part of little darlings—?”<br>“As yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!” The very act of<br>bringing it out really helped me to trace it—follow it all up and piece<br>it all together. “They haven’t been good—they’ve only been absent. It<br>has been easy to live with them, because they’re simply leading a life<br>of their own. They’re not mine—they’re not ours. They’re his and<br>they’re hers!”<br>“Quint’s and that woman’s?”<br>“Quint’s and that woman’s. They want to get to them.”<br>Oh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to study them! “But for<br>what?”<br>“For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful

, the pair<br>put into them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the<br>work of demons, is what brings the others back.”<br>“Laws!” said my friend under her breath. The exclamation was homely,<br>but it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the<br>bad time—for there had been a worse even than this!—must have occurred.<br>There could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent<br>of her experience to whatever depth of depravity I found credible in<br>our brace of scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of memory that<br>she brought out after a moment: “They _were_ rascals! But what can they<br>now do?” she pursued.<br>“Do?” I echoed so loud that Miles and Flora, as they passed at their<br>distance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. “Don’t they<br>do enough?” I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having<br>smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. We<br>were held by it a minute; then I answered: “They can destroy them!” At<br>this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent<br>one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. “They don’t<br>know, as yet, quite how—but they’re trying hard. They’re seen only<br>across, as it were, and beyond—in strange places and on high places,<br>the top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside of windows, the<br>further edge of pools; but there’s a deep design, on either side, to<br>shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle; and the success of the<br>tempters is only a question of time. They’ve only to keep to their<br>suggestions of danger.”<br>“For the children to come?”<br>“And perish in the attempt!” Mrs. Grose slowly got up, and I<br>scrupulously added: “Unless, of course, we can prevent!”<br>Standing there before me while I kept my seat, she visibly turned<br>things over. “Their uncle must do the preventing. He must take them<br>away.”<br>“And who’s to make him?”<br>She had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish<br>face. “You, miss.”<br>“By writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and<br>niece mad?”<br>“But if they _are_, miss?”<br>“And if I am myself, you mean? That’s charming news to be sent him by a<br>governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.”<br>Mrs. Grose considered, following the children again. “Yes, he do hate<br>worry. That was the great reason—”<br>“Why those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his<br>indifference must have been awful. As I’m not a fiend, at any rate, I<br>shouldn’t take him in.”<br>My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and<br>grasped my arm. “Make him at any rate come to you.”<br>I stared. “To _me?_” I had a sudden fear of what she might do. “‘Him’?”<br>“He ought to _be_ here—he ought to help.”<br>I quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her a queerer face than<br>ever yet. “You see me asking him for a visit?” No, with her eyes on my<br>face she evidently couldn’t. Instead of it even—as a woman reads<br>another—she could see what I myself saw: his derision, his amusement,<br>his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone<br>and for the fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his attention<br>to my slighted charms. She didn’t know—no one knew—how proud I had been<br>to serve him and to stick to our terms; yet she nonetheless took the<br>measure, I think, of the warning I now gave her. “If you should so lose<br>your head as to appeal to him for me—”<br>She was really frightened. “Yes, miss?”<br>“I would leave, on the spot, both him and you.”<br>#XIII<br>It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as<br>much as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in

 as I was sure then, my<br>mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were<br>aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a<br>manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don’t mean that<br>they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that<br>was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the<br>element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than<br>any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so<br>successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement. It was<br>as if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects<br>before which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we<br>perceived to be blind, closing with a little bang that made us look at<br>each other—for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had<br>intended—the doors we had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to Rome,<br>and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every<br>branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground.<br>Forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general<br>and of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends<br>little children had lost. There were days when I could have sworn that<br>one of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: “She<br>thinks she’ll do it this time—but she _won’t!_” To “do it” would have<br>been to indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct<br>reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had<br>a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which<br>I had again and again treated them; they were in possession of<br>everything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every<br>circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my<br>brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as<br>many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture<br>and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women<br>of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to<br>chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go<br>round. They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention<br>and my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when I thought of such<br>occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watched from<br>under cover. It was in any case over _my_ life, _my_ past, and _my_<br>friends alone that we could take anything like our ease—a state of<br>affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break<br>out into sociable reminders. I was invited—with no visible<br>connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling’s celebrated _mot_ or to<br>confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the<br>vicarage pony.<br>It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different<br>ones that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I<br>have called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for<br>me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have<br>done something toward soothing my nerves. Since the light brush, that<br>

 on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the<br>foot of the stair, I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house,<br>that one had better not have seen. There was many a corner round which<br>I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely<br>sinister way, would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel.

 had gone; the autumn had dropped upon Bly<br>and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its gray sky and<br>withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like<br>a theater after the performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills.<br>There were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of<br>stillness, unspeakable impressions of the _kind_ of ministering moment,<br>that brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the<br>medium in which, that

 evening out of doors, I had had my first<br>sight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had,<br>after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the<br>circle of shrubbery. I recognized the signs, the portents—I recognized<br>the moment, the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I<br>continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose<br>sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but<br>deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene of<br>Flora’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that it would<br>from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep<br>it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,<br>whether the children really saw or not—since, that is, it was not yet<br>definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of<br>my own exposure. I was ready to know the very worst that was to be<br>known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be<br>sealed just while theirs were most opened. Well, my eyes _were_ sealed,<br>it appeared, at present—a consummation for which it seemed blasphemous<br>not to thank God. There was, alas, a difficulty about that: I would<br>have thanked him with all my soul had I not had in a proportionate<br>measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils.<br>How can I retrace

 the strange steps of my obsession? There were<br>times of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that,<br>literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they<br>had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that, had I<br>not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove<br>greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken<br>out. “They’re here, they’re here, you little wretches,” I would have<br>cried, “and you can’t deny it now!” The little wretches denied it with<br>all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just<br>the crystal depths of which—like the flash of a fish in a stream—the<br>mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk<br>into me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see<br>either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over<br>whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had<br>straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which,<br>from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had<br>played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion<br>had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of<br>nerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed<br>me so that sometimes, at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly to<br>rehearse—it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the<br>manner in which I might come to the point. I approached it from one<br>side and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I<br>always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died<br>away on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to<br>represent something infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate<br>as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom,<br>probably, had ever known. When I said to myself: “_They_ have the<br>manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness to<br>speak!” I felt myself crimson and I covered my face with my hands.<br>After these secret scenes I chattered more than ever, going on volubly<br>enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes occurred—I can call<br>them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!)<br>into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the<br>more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and<br>that I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened<br>recitation or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that the others,<br>the outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they “passed,”<br>as the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the<br>fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more<br>infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough<br>for myself.<br>What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,<br>whatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw _more_—things terrible and<br>unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in<br>the past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a<br>chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three,<br>with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each<br>time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through<br>the very same movements. It was striking of the children, at all<br>events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and<br>never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had helped<br>us through many a peril. “When do you think he _will_ come? Don’t you<br>think we _ought_ to write?”—there was nothing like that inquiry, we<br>found by experience, for carrying off an awkwardness. “He” of course<br>was their uncle in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of<br>theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It<br>was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to<br>such a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon<br>we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions.<br>He never wrote to them—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of<br>the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his<br>highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal<br>celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I<br>carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when I<br>let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming<br>literary exercises. They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them<br>myself; I have them all to

. This was a rule indeed which only<br>added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that<br>he might at any moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges<br>knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me.<br>There appears to me, moreover, as I look back, no note in all this more<br>extraordinary than the mere fact that, in spite of my tension and of<br>their triumph, I never lost patience with them.

 had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and<br>sharp, made the church bells almost gay.

Why<br>did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society?

 by his uncle’s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of<br>pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles’s whole title to<br>independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon<br>him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had<br>nothing to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I<br>should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a<br>revolution because I now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain<br>rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was<br>precipitated. “Look here, my dear, you know,” he charmingly said, “when<br>in the world, please, am I going back to school?”<br>Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly as<br>uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all<br>interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off<br>intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them<br>that always made one “catch,” and I caught, at any rate, now so<br>effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park<br>had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot,<br>between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though, to<br>enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and<br>charming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my at<br>first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained.<br>I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after

, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: “You<br>know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady _always_—!” His “my<br>dear” was constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have<br>expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to<br>inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully<br>easy.<br>But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I<br>remember that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see in<br>the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer I<br>looked. “And always with the same lady?” I returned.<br>He neither blanched nor winked. The whole thing was virtually out<br>between us. “Ah, of course, she’s a jolly, ‘perfect’ lady; but, after<br>all, I’m a fellow, don’t you see? that’s—well, getting on.”<br>I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. “Yes, you’re<br>getting on.” Oh, but I felt helpless!<br>I have kept to

 the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed<br>to know that and to play with it. “And you can’t say I’ve not been<br>awfully good, can you?”<br>I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it<br>would have been to walk on, I was not yet quite able. “No, I can’t say<br>that, Miles.”<br>“Except

?” I couldn’t look as straight as he.<br>“Why, when I went down—went out of the house.”<br>“Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.”<br>“You forget?”—he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish<br>reproach. “Why, it was to show you I could!”<br>“Oh, yes, you could.”<br>“And I can again.”<br>I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits<br>about me. “Certainly. But you won’t.”<br>“No, not _that_ again. It was nothing.”<br>“It was nothing,” I said. “But we must go on.”<br>He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. “Then when<br>_am_ I going back?”<br>I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. “Were you very<br>happy at school?”<br>He just considered. “Oh, I’m happy enough anywhere!”<br>“Well, then,” I quavered, “if you’re just as happy here—!”<br>“Ah, but that isn’t everything! Of course _you_ know a lot—”<br>“But you hint that you know almost as much?” I risked as he paused.<br>“Not half I want to!” Miles honestly professed. “But it isn’t so much<br>that.”<br>“What is it, then?”<br>“Well—I want to see more life.”<br>“I see; I see.” We had arrived within sight of the church and of<br>various persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their<br>way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened our<br>step; I wanted to get there before the question between us opened up<br>much further; I reflected hungrily that, for

 of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on<br>which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race<br>with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that<br>he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he<br>threw out—<br>“I want my own sort!”<br>It literally made me bound forward. “There are not many of your own<br>sort, Miles!” I laughed. “Unless perhaps dear little Flora!”<br>“You really compare me to a baby girl?”<br>This found me singularly weak. “Don’t you, then, _love_ our sweet<br>Flora?”<br>“If I didn’t—and you, too; if I didn’t—!” he repeated as if retreating<br>for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had<br>come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the<br>pressure of his arm, had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had<br>passed into the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we<br>were, for

, alone among the old, thick graves. We had paused,<br>on the path from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike tomb.<br>“Yes, if you didn’t—?”<br>He looked, while I waited, at the graves. “Well, you know what!” But he<br>didn’t move, and he presently produced something that made me drop<br>straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. “Does my uncle<br>think what _you_ think?”<br>I markedly rested. “How do you know what I think?”<br>“Ah, well, of course I don’t; for it strikes me you never tell me. But<br>I mean does _he_ know?”<br>“Know what, Miles?”<br>“Why, the way I’m going on.”<br>I perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no<br>answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer.<br>Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed<br>to make that venial. “I don’t think your uncle much cares.”<br>Miles, on this, stood looking at me. “Then don’t you think he can be<br>made to?”<br>“In what way?”<br>“Why, by his coming down.”<br>“But who’ll get him to come down?”<br>“_I_ will!” the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He<br>gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off<br>alone into church.<br>#XV<br>The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed<br>him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of<br>this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb<br>and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its<br>meaning; by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also<br>embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my<br>pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What<br>I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me<br>and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse.<br>He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and<br>that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his<br>own purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the<br>intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for<br>that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. That<br>his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution<br>that, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I<br>could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply<br>procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my deep<br>discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to<br>me: “Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this<br>interruption of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you<br>a life that’s so unnatural for a boy.” What was so unnatural for the<br>particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a<br>consciousness and a plan.<br>That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked<br>round the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already,<br>with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up<br>nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into<br>the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into<br>mine and make me sit there for

 in close, silent contact with<br>his commentary on our talk. For

 since his arrival I<br>wanted to get away from him. As I paused beneath the high east window<br>and listened to the sounds of worship, I was taken with an impulse that<br>might master me, I felt, completely should I give it the least<br>encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting<br>away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I<br>could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a<br>question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which<br>the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically<br>have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just<br>drive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till<br>dinner? That would be in

, at the end of which—I had<br>the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder<br>about my nonappearance in their train.<br>“What _did_ you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry<br>us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don’t you know?—did you desert us<br>at the very door?” I couldn’t meet such questions nor, as they asked<br>them, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what I<br>should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at

let myself go.<br>I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came<br>straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps<br>through the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house<br>I had made up my mind I would fly. The

 stillness both of the<br>approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited<br>me with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I<br>should get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have<br>to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the<br>great one to settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and<br>obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the<br>staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a<br>revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where

, in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I<br>had seen the specter of the most horrible of women. At this I was able<br>to straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my<br>bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to<br>me that I should have to take. But I opened the door to find again, in<br>a flash, my eyes unsealed. In the presence of what I saw I reeled<br>straight back upon my resistance.<br>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom,<br>without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush<br>for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the<br>place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of<br>the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself<br>to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an<br>effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands<br>with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took<br>this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her<br>attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its<br>announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture.<br>She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand<br>melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of<br>me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was<br>all before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the<br>awful image passed away. Dark as

 in her black dress, her<br>haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long<br>enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good<br>as mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the<br>extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It<br>was as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—“You<br>terrible, miserable woman!”—I heard myself break into a sound that, by<br>the open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. She<br>looked at me as if she heard me, but I had recovered myself and cleared<br>the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine<br>and a sense that I must stay.<br>#XVI<br>I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be<br>marked by a demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take<br>into account that they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily<br>denouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion to my having failed<br>them, and I was left, for the time, on perceiving that she too said<br>nothing, to study Mrs. Grose’s odd face. I did this to such purpose<br>that I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a silence<br>that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private<br>opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured

<br>with her in the housekeeper’s room, where, in the twilight, amid a<br>smell of lately baked bread, but with the place all swept and<br>garnished, I found her sitting in pained placidity before the fire. So<br>I see her still, so I see her best: facing the flame from her straight<br>chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the “put<br>away”—of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy.<br>“Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them—so long as<br>they were there—of course I promised. But what had happened to you?”<br>“I only went with you for the walk,” I said. “I had then to come back<br>to meet a friend.”<br>She showed her surprise. “A friend—_you?_”<br>“Oh, yes, I have a couple!” I laughed. “But did the children give you a<br>reason?”<br>“For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it<br>better. Do you like it better?”<br>My face had made her rueful. “No, I like it worse!” But after an<br>instant I added: “Did they say why I should like it better?”<br>“No; Master Miles only said, ‘We must do nothing but what she likes!’”<br>“I wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?”<br>“Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, ‘Oh, of course, of course!’—and I<br>said the same.”<br>I thought a moment. “You were too sweet, too—I can hear you all. But<br>nonetheless, between Miles and me, it’s now all out.”<br>“All out?” My companion stared. “But what, miss?”<br>“Everything. It doesn’t matter. I’ve made up my mind. I came home, my<br>dear,” I went on, “for a talk with Miss Jessel.”<br>I had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs. Grose literally well<br>in hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as she<br>bravely blinked under the signal of my word, I could keep her<br>comparatively firm. “A talk! Do you mean she spoke?”<br>“It came to that. I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.”<br>“And what did she say?” I can hear the good woman still, and the candor<br>of her stupefaction.<br>“That she suffers the torments—!”<br>It was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture,<br>gape. “Do you mean,” she faltered, “—of the lost?”<br>“Of the lost. Of the damned. And that’s why, to share them—” I faltered<br>myself with the horror of it.<br>But my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. “To share them—?”<br>“She wants Flora.” Mrs. Grose might, as I gave it to her, fairly have<br>fallen away from me had I not been prepared. I still held her there, to<br>show I was. “As I’ve told you, however, it doesn’t matter.”<br>“Because you’ve made up your mind? But to what?”<br>“To everything.”<br>“And what do you call ‘everything’?”<br>“Why, sending for their uncle.”<br>“Oh, miss, in pity do,” my friend broke out. “ah, but I will, I _will!_<br>I see it’s the only way. What’s ‘out,’ as I told you, with Miles is<br>that if he thinks I’m afraid to—and has ideas of what he gains by<br>that—he shall see he’s mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here<br>from me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if<br>I’m to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school—”<br>“Yes, miss—” my companion pressed me.<br>“Well, there’s that awful reason.”<br>There were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she<br>was excusable for being vague. “But—a—which?”<br>“Why, the letter from his old place.”<br>“You’ll show it to the master?”<br>“I ought to have done so on the instant.”<br>“Oh, no!” said Mrs. Grose with decision.<br>“I’ll put it before him,” I went on inexorably, “that I can’t undertake<br>to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled—”<br>“For we’ve never in the least known what!” Mrs. Grose declared.<br>“For wickedness. For what else—when he’s so clever and beautiful and<br>perfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured?<br>He’s exquisite—so it can be only _that_; and that would open up the<br>whole thing. After all,” I said, “it’s their uncle’s fault. If he left<br>here such people—!”<br>“He didn’t really in the least know them. The fault’s mine.” She had<br>turned quite pale.<br>“Well, you shan’t suffer,” I answered.<br>“The children shan’t!” she emphatically returned.<br>I was silent awhile; we looked at each other. “Then what am I to tell<br>him?”<br>“You needn’t tell him anything. _I’ll_ tell him.”<br>I measured this. “Do you mean you’ll write—?” Remembering she couldn’t,<br>I caught myself up. “How do you communicate?”<br>“I tell the bailiff. _He_ writes.”<br>“And should you like him to write our story?”<br>My question had a sarcastic force that I had not fully intended, and it<br>made her, after a moment, inconsequently break down. The tears were<br>again in her eyes. “Ah, miss, _you_ write!”<br>“Well—

,” I at last answered; and on this we separated.<br>#XVII<br>I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had<br>changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my<br>room, with Flora at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a<br>blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the<br>batter of the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the<br>passage and listened

 at Miles’s door. What, under my endless<br>obsession, I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his<br>not being at rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I<br>had expected. His voice tinkled out. “I say, you there—come in.” It was<br>a gaiety in the gloom!<br>I went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but<br>very much at his ease. “Well, what are _you_ up to?” he asked with a<br>grace of sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs. Grose, had<br>she been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was<br>“out.”<br>I stood over him with my candle. “How did you know I was there?”<br>“Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You’re<br>like a troop of cavalry!” he beautifully laughed.<br>“Then you weren’t asleep?”<br>“Not much! I lie awake and think.”<br>I had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held<br>out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.<br>“What is it,” I asked, “that you think of?”<br>“What in the world, my dear, but _you?_”<br>“Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn’t insist on that! I<br>had so far rather you slept.”<br>“Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.”<br>I marked the coolness of his firm little hand. “Of what queer business,<br>Miles?”<br>“Why, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!”<br>I fairly held my breath

, though I felt, as I held his hand and<br>our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of<br>admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was<br>perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. “Certainly<br>you shall go back to school,” I said, “if it be that that troubles you.<br>But not to the old place—we must find another, a better. How could I<br>know it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so,<br>never spoke of it at all?” His clear, listening face, framed in its<br>smooth whiteness, made him for

 as appealing as some wistful<br>patient in a children’s hospital; and I would have given, as the<br>resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse<br>or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even<br>as it was, I perhaps might help! “Do you know you’ve never said a word<br>to me about your school—I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any<br>way?”<br>He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly<br>gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. “Haven’t I?” It wasn’t<br>for _me_ to help him—it was for the thing I had met!<br>Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this<br>from him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet<br>known; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled<br>and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a<br>part of innocence and consistency. “No, never—from

 you came<br>back. You’ve never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your<br>comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at<br>school. Never, little Miles—no, never—have you given me an inkling of<br>anything that _may_ have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how<br>much I’m in the dark. Until you came out, that way,

 I saw you, scarce even made a reference to<br>anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the<br>present.” It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret<br>precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I<br>dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his<br>inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person—imposed him<br>almost as an intellectual equal. “I thought you wanted to go on as you<br>are.”<br>It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any<br>rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his<br>head. “I don’t—I don’t. I want to get away.”<br>“You’re tired of Bly?”<br>“Oh, no, I like Bly.”<br>“Well, then—?”<br>“Oh, _you_ know what a boy wants!”<br>I felt that I didn’t know so well as Miles, and I took temporary<br>refuge. “You want to go to your uncle?”<br>Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the<br>pillow. “Ah, you can’t get off with that!”<br>I was silent a little, and it was I, now, I think, who changed color.<br>“My dear, I don’t want to get off!”<br>“You can’t, even if you do. You can’t, you can’t!”—he lay beautifully<br>staring. “My uncle must come down, and you must completely settle<br>things.”<br>“If we do,” I returned with some spirit, “you may be sure it will be to<br>take you quite away.”<br>“Well, don’t you understand that that’s exactly what I’m working for?<br>You’ll have to tell him—about the way you’ve let it all drop: you’ll<br>have to tell him a tremendous lot!”<br>The exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the<br>instant, to meet him rather more. “And how much will _you_, Miles, have<br>to tell him? There are things he’ll ask you!”<br>He turned it over. “Very likely. But what things?”<br>“The things you’ve never told me. To make up his mind what to do with<br>you. He can’t send you back—”<br>“Oh, I don’t want to go back!” he broke in. “I want a new field.”<br>He said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety;<br>and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the<br>poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance<br>at

 with all this bravado and still more<br>dishonor. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear<br>that, and it made me let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the<br>tenderness of my pity I embraced him. “Dear little Miles, dear little<br>Miles—!”<br>My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with<br>indulgent good humor. “Well, old lady?”<br>“Is there nothing—nothing at all that you want to tell me?”<br>He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his<br>hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. “I’ve told you—I<br>told you

.”<br>Oh, I was sorry for him! “That you just want me not to worry you?”<br>He looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding<br>him; then ever so gently, “To let me alone,” he replied.<br>There was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made me<br>release him, yet, when I had slowly risen, linger beside him. God knows<br>I never wished to harass him, but I felt that merely, at this, to turn<br>my back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose him.<br>“I’ve just begun a letter to your uncle,” I said.<br>“Well, then, finish it!”<br>I waited

. “What happened before?”<br>He gazed up at me again. “Before what?”<br>“Before you came back. And before you went away.”<br>For some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. “What<br>happened?”<br>It made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that I<br>caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting<br>consciousness—it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once<br>more the chance of possessing him. “Dear little Miles, dear little<br>Miles, if you _knew_ how I want to help you! It’s only that, it’s<br>nothing but that, and I’d rather die than give you a pain or do you a<br>wrong—I’d rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear little Miles”—oh, I<br>brought it out now even if I _should_ go too far—“I just want you to<br>help me to save you!” But I knew in a moment after this that I had gone<br>too far. The answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the<br>form of an extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of frozen air, and a<br>shake of the room as great as if, in the wild wind, the casement had<br>crashed in. The boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest<br>of the shock of sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so<br>close to him, a note either of jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my<br>feet again and was conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained,<br>while I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred<br>and the window tight. “Why, the candle’s out!” I then cried.<br>“It was I who blew it, dear!” said Miles.<br>#XVIII<br>

—that my letter,<br>sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would be time enough<br>to send it before the messenger should go to the village. Meanwhile<br>there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more<br>exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to<br>gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest<br>feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of _my_ feeble range, and<br>perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical<br>jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he<br>appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child,<br>to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no<br>words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every<br>impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the<br>uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more<br>extraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the<br>wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me; to<br>check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which I constantly<br>both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman<br>could have done that deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy<br>I knew, the imagination of all evil _had_ been opened up to him: all<br>the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have<br>flowered into an act.<br>He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after<br>our early dinner on

, to play to me. David playing to<br>Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was<br>literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite<br>tantamount to his saying outright: “The true knights we love to read<br>about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you<br>mean that—to be let alone yourself and not followed up—you’ll cease to<br>worry and spy upon me, won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go<br>and come. Well, I ‘come,’ you see—but I don’t go! There’ll be plenty of<br>time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to<br>show you that I contended for a principle.” It may be imagined whether<br>I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand,<br>to the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he had<br>never played; and if there are those who think he had better have been<br>kicking a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them. For at<br>the end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to<br>measure, I started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at<br>my post. It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I<br>hadn’t really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much<br>worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the<br>question to Miles, he played on

 before answering and then<br>could only say: “Why, my dear, how do _I_ know?”—breaking moreover into<br>a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal<br>accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.<br>I went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before<br>going downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere<br>about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of that<br>theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I had<br>found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with<br>blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast,<br>I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her<br>right, for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out<br>of my sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed she<br>might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for<br>her without an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but<br>when,

 there,<br>apart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with<br>what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first<br>given her.<br>“She’ll be above,” she presently said—“in one of the rooms you haven’t<br>searched.”<br>“No; she’s at a distance.” I had made up my mind. “She has gone out.”<br>Mrs. Grose stared. “Without a hat?”<br>I naturally also looked volumes. “Isn’t that woman always without one?”<br>“She’s with _her?_”<br>“She’s with _her!_” I declared. “We must find them.”<br>My hand was on my friend’s arm, but she failed for the moment,<br>confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my<br>pressure. She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her<br>uneasiness. “And where’s Master Miles?”<br>“Oh, _he’s_ with Quint. They’re in the schoolroom.”<br>“Lord, miss!” My view, I was myself aware—and therefore I suppose my<br>tone—had never yet reached so calm an assurance.<br>“The trick’s played,” I went on; “they’ve successfully worked their<br>plan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she<br>went off.”<br>“‘Divine’?” Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.<br>“Infernal, then!” I almost cheerfully rejoined. “He has provided for<br>himself as well. But come!”<br>She had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. “You leave him—?”<br>“So long with Quint? Yes—I don’t mind that now.”<br>She always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand,<br>and in this manner she could at present still stay me. But after<br>gasping an instant at my sudden resignation, “Because of your letter?”<br>she eagerly brought out.<br>I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it<br>up, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great hall table.<br>“Luke will take it,” I said as I came back. I reached the house door<br>and opened it; I was already on the steps.<br>My companion still demurred: the storm of the night and

 was damp and gray. I came down<br>to the drive while she stood in the doorway. “You go with nothing on?”<br>“What do I care when the child has nothing? I can’t wait to dress,” I<br>cried, “and if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself,<br>upstairs.”<br>“With _them?_” Oh, on this, the poor woman promptly joined me!<br>#XIX<br>We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay<br>rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet<br>of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes. My<br>acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at<br>all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection<br>of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat<br>moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its<br>agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the<br>house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be,<br>she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small<br>adventure, and, since

 of the very great one that I had shared<br>with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of

 to<br>which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose’s<br>steps so marked a direction—a direction that made her, when she<br>perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly<br>mystified. “You’re going to the water, Miss?—you think she’s _in_—?”<br>“She may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But<br>what I judge most likely is that she’s on the spot from which, the<br>other day, we saw together what I told you.”<br>“When she pretended not to see—?”<br>“With that astounding self-possession? I’ve always been sure she wanted<br>to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.”<br>Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. “You suppose they really<br>_talk_ of them?”<br>“I could meet this with a confidence! They say things that, if we heard<br>them, would simply appall us.”<br>“And if she _is_ there—”<br>“Yes?”<br>“Then Miss Jessel is?”<br>“Beyond a doubt. You shall see.”<br>“Oh, thank you!” my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I<br>went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however,<br>she was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her<br>apprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as<br>her least danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in<br>sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child.<br>There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my<br>observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite<br>edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came<br>down to the water. The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant<br>compared to its length that, with its ends out of view, it might have<br>been taken for a scant river. We looked at the empty expanse, and then<br>I felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes. I knew what she meant and I<br>replied with a negative headshake.<br>“No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.”<br>My companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across<br>the lake. “Then where is it?”<br>“Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go<br>over, and then has managed to hide it.”<br>“All alone—that child?”<br>“She’s not alone, and at such times she’s not a child: she’s an old,<br>old woman.” I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took<br>again, into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges of<br>submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a<br>small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation<br>masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump<br>of trees growing close to the water.<br>“But if the boat’s there, where on earth’s _she?_” my colleague<br>anxiously asked.<br>“That’s exactly what we must learn.” And I started to walk further.<br>“By going all the way round?”<br>“Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but

, but it’s far<br>enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight<br>over.”<br>“Laws!” cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much<br>for her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got<br>halfway round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by<br>a path choked with overgrowth—I paused to give her breath. I sustained<br>her with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely help me;<br>and this started us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes<br>more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where I had<br>supposed it. It had been intentionally left as much as possible out of<br>sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just<br>there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to<br>disembarking. I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short, thick<br>oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a<br>little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and<br>had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in the<br>fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling<br>interval, more into the open. Then, “There she is!” we both exclaimed<br>at once.<br>Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if<br>her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was<br>to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were all she was there<br>for—a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became sure she had<br>just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself taking a<br>step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently<br>approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done<br>in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose was the first<br>to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the<br>child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,<br>yielding body. While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only watch<br>it—which I did the more intently when I saw Flora’s face peep at me<br>over our companion’s shoulder. It was serious now—the flicker had left<br>it; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied<br>Mrs. Grose the simplicity of _her_ relation. Still, all this while,<br>nothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern<br>again drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each<br>other was that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose finally got<br>up she kept the child’s hand, so that the two were still before me; and<br>the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the<br>frank look she launched me. “I’ll be hanged,” it said, “if _I’ll_<br>speak!”<br>It was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.<br>She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. “Why, where are your<br>things?”<br>“Where yours are, my dear!” I promptly returned.<br>She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an<br>answer quite sufficient. “And where’s Miles?” she went on.<br>There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:<br>these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn<br>blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for

, had<br>held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt<br>overflow in a deluge. “I’ll tell you if you’ll tell _me_—” I heard<br>myself say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.<br>“Well, what?”<br>Mrs. Grose’s suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I<br>brought the thing out handsomely. “Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?”<br>#XX<br>Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much<br>as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,<br>been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s face now<br>received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a<br>pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,<br>that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence—the<br>shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within<br>

, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my<br>colleague’s arm. “She’s there, she’s there!”<br>Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had<br>stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling<br>now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She<br>was there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel<br>nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there<br>most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so<br>extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her—with the<br>sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and<br>understand it—an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on<br>the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all<br>the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. This<br>first vividness of vision and emotion were things of

,<br>during which Mrs. Grose’s dazed blink across to where I pointed struck<br>me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my<br>own eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation then of the manner<br>in which Flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it<br>would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was<br>of course not what I had expected. Prepared and on her guard as our<br>pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and I<br>was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the<br>particular one for which I had not allowed. To see her, without a<br>convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the<br>direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn<br>at _me_ an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely<br>new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge<br>me—this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself<br>into the very presence that could make me quail. I quailed even though<br>my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that<br>instant, and in the immediate need to defend myself I called it<br>passionately to witness. “She’s there, you little unhappy thing—there,<br>there, _there_, and you see her as well as you see me!” I had said<br>shortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a child,<br>but an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been<br>more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to<br>this, she simply showed me, without a concession, an admission, of her<br>eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite<br>fixed, reprobation. I was by this time—if I can put the whole thing at<br>all together—more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than<br>at anything else, though it was simultaneously with this that I became<br>aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with.<br>My elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blotted out<br>everything but her own flushed face and her loud, shocked protest, a<br>burst of high disapproval. “What a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss!<br>Where on earth do you see anything?”<br>I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the<br>hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already<br>lasted

, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague,<br>quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my<br>pointing hand. “You don’t see her exactly as _we_ see?—you mean to say<br>you don’t now—_now?_ She’s as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest<br>woman, _look_—!” She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep<br>groan of negation, repulsion, compassion—the mixture with her pity of<br>her relief at her exemption—a sense, touching to me even then, that she<br>would have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that,<br>for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly<br>sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt—I saw—my livid<br>predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was<br>conscious, more than all, of what I should have from this instant to<br>deal with in the astounding little attitude of Flora. Into this<br>attitude Mrs. Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even<br>while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private<br>triumph, into breathless reassurance.<br>“She isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there—and you never see<br>nothing, my sweet! How can poor Miss Jessel—when poor Miss Jessel’s<br>dead and buried? _We_ know, don’t we, love?”—and she appealed,<br>blundering in, to the child. “It’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a<br>joke—and we’ll go home as fast as we can!”<br>Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of<br>propriety, and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united, as<br>it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with her<br>small mask of reprobation, and even at

 I prayed God to<br>forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to<br>our friend’s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly<br>failed, had quite vanished. I’ve said it already—she was literally, she<br>was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. “I don’t<br>know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never _have_. I<br>think you’re cruel. I don’t like you!” Then, after this deliverance,<br>which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the<br>street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the<br>dreadful little face. In this position she produced an almost furious<br>wail. “Take me away, take me away—oh, take me away from _her!_”<br>“From _me?_” I panted.<br>“From you—from you!” she cried.<br>Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to do<br>but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank,<br>without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the<br>interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was<br>not there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if<br>she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words,<br>and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept, but<br>sadly shake my head at her. “If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would<br>at present have gone. I’ve been living with the miserable truth, and<br>now it has only too much closed round me. Of course I’ve lost you: I’ve<br>interfered, and you’ve seen—under _her_ dictation”—with which I faced,<br>over the pool again, our infernal witness—“the easy and perfect way to<br>meet it. I’ve done my best, but I’ve lost you. Goodbye.” For Mrs. Grose
I had an imperative, an almost frantic “Go, go!” before which, in<br>infinite distress, but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly<br>convinced, in spite of her blindness, that something awful had occurred<br>and some collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come,<br>as fast as she could move.<br>Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent<br>memory. I only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an<br>hour, an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and piercing my<br>trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown myself, on my<br>face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief. I must have<br>lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head

was almost done. I got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at<br>the gray pool and its blank, haunted edge, and then I took, back to the<br>house, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached the gate in the<br>fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh<br>reflection to make on Flora’s extraordinary command of the situation.<br>She passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not<br>the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with<br>Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand,<br>as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw—I<br>can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were more<br>than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the<br>portentous quality of this one; in spite of which—and in spite also of<br>the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my<br>feet—there was literally, in the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily<br>sweet sadness. On reaching the house I had never so much as looked for<br>the boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was<br>wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to Flora’s<br>rupture. Her little belongings had all been removed. When later, by the<br>schoolroom fire, I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged,<br>on the article of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his<br>freedom now—he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it; and it<br>consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at

 and<br>sitting down with me in silence. On the removal of the tea things I had<br>blown out the candles and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a<br>mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. So, when<br>he appeared, I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a<br>moment by the door as if to look at me; then—as if to share them—came<br>to the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair. We sat there in<br>absolute stillness; yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.<br>#XXI<br>Before

 of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had<br>for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present,<br>governess. It was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss Jessel<br>on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuously and passionately<br>against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense<br>deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her<br>loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the<br>question of her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. “She<br>persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?”<br>My visitor’s trouble, truly, was great. “Ah, miss, it isn’t a matter on<br>which I can push her! Yet it isn’t either, I must say, as if I much<br>needed to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.”<br>“Oh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents, for all the world like<br>some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and, as<br>it were, her respectability. ‘Miss Jessel indeed—_she!_’ Ah, she’s<br>‘respectable,’ the chit! The impression she gave me there

<br>was, I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any<br>of the others. I _did_ put my foot in it! She’ll never speak to me<br>again.”<br>Hideous and obscure as it all was, it held Mrs. Grose briefly silent;<br>then she granted my point with a frankness which, I made sure, had more<br>behind it. “I think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a grand<br>manner about it!”<br>“And that manner”—I summed it up—“is practically what’s the matter with<br>her now!”<br>Oh, that manner, I could see in my visitor’s face, and not a little<br>else besides! “She asks me

 if I think you’re coming<br>in.”<br>“I see—I see.” I, too, on my side, had so much more than worked it out.<br>“Has she said to you since

—except to repudiate her<br>familiarity with anything so dreadful—a single other word about Miss
Jessel?”<br>“Not one, miss. And of course you know,” my friend added, “I took it<br>from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there _was_<br>nobody.”<br>“Rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.”<br>“I don’t contradict her. What else can I do?”<br>“Nothing in the world! You’ve the cleverest little person to deal with.<br>They’ve made them—their two friends, I mean—still cleverer even than<br>nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! Flora has now her<br>grievance, and she’ll work it to the end.”<br>“Yes, miss; but to _what_ end?”<br>“Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She’ll make me out to him<br>the lowest creature—!”<br>I winced at the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose’s face; she looked<br>for

 as if she sharply saw them together. “And him who thinks<br>so well of you!”<br>“He has an odd way—it comes over me now,” I laughed, “—of proving it!<br>But that doesn’t matter. What Flora wants, of course, is to get rid of<br>me.”<br>My companion bravely concurred. “Never again to so much as look at<br>you.”<br>“So that what you’ve come to me now for,” I asked, “is to speed me on<br>my way?” Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check.<br>“I’ve a better idea—the result of my reflections. My going _would_ seem<br>the right thing, and on

 I was terribly near it. Yet that won’t<br>do. It’s _you_ who must go. You must take Flora.”<br>My visitor, at this, did speculate. “But where in the world—?”<br>“Away from here. Away from _them_. Away, even most of all, now, from<br>me. Straight to her uncle.”<br>“Only to tell on you—?”<br>“No, not ‘only’! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.”<br>She was still vague. “And what _is_ your remedy?”<br>“Your loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles’s.”<br>She looked at me hard. “Do you think he—?”<br>“Won’t, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think<br>it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as<br>possible and leave me with him alone.” I was amazed, myself, at the<br>spirit I had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more<br>disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it,<br>she hesitated. “There’s one thing, of course,” I went on: “they<br>mustn’t, before she goes, see each other for

.” Then it<br>came over me that, in spite of Flora’s presumable sequestration from<br>the instant of her return from the pool, it might already be too late.<br>“Do you mean,” I anxiously asked, “that they _have_ met?”<br>At this she quite flushed. “Ah, miss, I’m not such a fool as that! If<br>I’ve been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has been each<br>time with one of the maids, and at present, though she’s alone, she’s<br>locked in safe.

.<br>All the same,” I continued, “I can’t, if her uncle sees her, consent to<br>his seeing her brother without my having given the boy—and most of all<br>because things have got so bad—a little more time.”<br>My friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than I could quite<br>understand. “What do you mean by more time?”<br>“Well, a day or two—really to bring it out. He’ll then be on _my_<br>side—of which you see the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only<br>fail, and you will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your<br>arrival in town, whatever you may have found possible.” So I put it<br>before her, but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed<br>that I came again to her aid. “Unless, indeed,” I wound up, “you really<br>want _not_ to go.”<br>I could see it, in her face, at last clear itself; she put out her hand<br>to me as a pledge. “I’ll go—I’ll go. I’ll go

.”<br>I wanted to be very just. “If you _should_ wish still to wait, I would<br>engage she shouldn’t see me.”<br>“No, no: it’s the place itself. She must leave it.” She held me a<br>moment with heavy eyes, then brought out the rest. “Your idea’s the<br>right one. I myself, miss—”<br>“Well?”<br>“I can’t stay.”<br>The look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities. “You mean<br>that, since

, you _have_ seen—?”<br>She shook her head with dignity. “I’ve _heard_—!”<br>“Heard?”<br>“From that child—horrors! There!” she sighed with tragic relief. “On my<br>honor, miss, she says things—!” But at this evocation she broke down;<br>she dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, as I had seen her do<br>before, gave way to all the grief of it.<br>It was quite in another manner that I, for my part, let myself go. “Oh,<br>thank God!”<br>She sprang up again at this, drying her eyes with a groan. “‘Thank<br>God’?”<br>“It so justifies me!”<br>“It does that, miss!”<br>I couldn’t have desired more emphasis, but I just hesitated. “She’s so<br>horrible?”<br>I saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it. “Really shocking.”<br>“And about me?”<br>“About you, miss—since you must have it. It’s beyond everything, for a<br>young lady; and I can’t think wherever she must have picked up—”<br>“The appalling language she applied to me? I can, then!” I broke in<br>with a laugh that was doubtless significant enough.<br>It only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. “Well, perhaps I<br>ought to also—since I’ve heard some of it before! Yet I can’t bear it,”<br>the poor woman went on while, with the same movement, she glanced, on<br>my dressing table, at the face of my watch. “But I must go back.”<br>I kept her, however. “Ah, if you can’t bear it—!”<br>“How can I stop with her, you mean? Why, just _for_ that: to get her<br>away. Far from this,” she pursued, “far from _them_—”<br>“She may be different? She may be free?” I seized her almost with joy.<br>“Then, in spite of

, you _believe_—”<br>“In such doings?” Her simple description of them required, in the light<br>of her expression, to be carried no further, and she gave me the whole<br>thing as she had never done. “I believe.”<br>Yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if I might<br>continue sure of that I should care but little what else happened. My<br>support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in<br>my early need of confidence, and if my friend would answer for my<br>honesty, I would answer for all the rest. On the point of taking leave<br>of her, nonetheless, I was to some extent embarrassed. “There’s one<br>thing, of course—it occurs to me—to remember. My letter, giving the<br>alarm, will have reached town before you.”<br>I now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and<br>how weary at last it had made her. “Your letter won’t have got there.<br>Your letter never went.”<br>“What then became of it?”<br>“Goodness knows! Master Miles—”<br>“Do you mean _he_ took it?” I gasped.<br>She hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. “I mean that I saw<br>

 I had the chance to question Luke, and<br>he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.” We could only<br>exchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual soundings, and it was Mrs.<br>Grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated “You see!”<br>“Yes, I see that if Miles took it instead he probably will have read it<br>and destroyed it.”<br>“And don’t you see anything else?”<br>I faced her a moment with a sad smile. “It strikes me that by this time<br>your eyes are open even wider than mine.”<br>They proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show<br>it. “I make out now what he must have done at school.” And she gave, in<br>her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. “He stole!”<br>I turned it over—I tried to be more judicial. “Well—perhaps.”<br>She looked as if she found me unexpectedly calm. “He stole _letters!_”<br>She couldn’t know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow;<br>so I showed them off as I might. “I hope then it was to more purpose<br>than in this case!

 was precisely the need of confession.” I<br>seemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to see it all.<br>“Leave us, leave us”—I was already, at the door, hurrying her off.<br>“I’ll get it out of him. He’ll meet me—he’ll confess. If he confesses,<br>he’s saved. And if he’s saved—”<br>“Then _you_ are?” The dear woman kissed me on this, and I took her<br>farewell. “I’ll save you without him!” she cried as she went.<br>#XXII<br>Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—that the<br>great pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give me to<br>find myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least, that it<br>would give me a measure.

, while I fought my<br>weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a<br>tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that,<br>for the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused<br>reflection of the crisis. What had happened naturally caused them all<br>to stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we<br>might, in the suddenness of my colleague’s act. The maids and the men<br>looked blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until<br>I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely, in<br>short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and I<br>dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand<br>and very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much<br>to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I<br>was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for

 or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I<br>were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,<br>I paraded with a sick heart.<br>The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner,<br>little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no<br>glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change<br>taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the<br>piano,

, kept me, in Flora’s interest, so beguiled and<br>befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her<br>confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by<br>our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had<br>already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I<br>learned below that he had breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of
the maids—with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he<br>said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have<br>expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office.<br>What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be<br>settled: there was a queer relief, at all events—I mean for myself in<br>especial—in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung<br>to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had<br>perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction<br>that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that,<br>by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out<br>the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off<br>straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any<br>rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply<br>shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous<br>

, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded,<br>neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other<br>ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them,<br>the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by<br>the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet,<br>for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.<br>To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my<br>meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so<br>that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside<br>of the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared<br>

, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light.<br>Here at present I felt afresh—for I had felt it again and again—how my<br>equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut<br>my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what I had to deal with<br>was, revoltingly, against nature. I could only get on at all by taking<br>“nature” into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous<br>ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but<br>demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw<br>of ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require<br>more tact than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, _all_ the<br>nature. How could I put even a little of that article into a<br>suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand,<br>could I make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure?<br>Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far<br>confirmed as that I was met, incontestably, by the quickened vision of<br>what was rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found<br>even now—as he had so often found at lessons—still some other delicate<br>way to ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we shared<br>our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite<br>worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had<br>now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego<br>the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his<br>intelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn’t one, to reach<br>his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was<br>as if, when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally<br>shown me the way. The roast mutton was on the table, and I had<br>dispensed with attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment<br>with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he<br>seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he<br>presently produced was: “I say, my dear, is she really very awfully<br>ill?”<br>“Little Flora? Not so bad but that she’ll presently be better. London
will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take<br>your mutton.”<br>He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and,<br>when he was established, went on. “Did Bly disagree with her so<br>terribly suddenly?”<br>“Not so suddenly as you might think. One had seen it coming on.”<br>“Then why didn’t you get her off before?”<br>“Before what?”<br>“Before she became too ill to travel.”<br>I found myself prompt. “She’s _not_ too ill to travel: she only might<br>have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize.<br>The journey will dissipate the influence”—oh, I was grand!—“and carry<br>it off.”<br>“I see, I see”—Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to<br>his repast with the charming little “table manner” that, from

<br>of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition.<br>Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly<br>feeding. He was irreproachable, as always,

; but he was<br>unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for<br>granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and<br>he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. Our meal<br>was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense, and I had the things<br>immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his<br>hands in his little pockets and his back to me—stood and looked out of<br>the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled<br>me up. We continued silent while the maid was with us—as silent, it<br>whimsically occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding<br>journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. He turned<br>round only when the waiter had left us. “Well—so we’re alone!”<br>#XXIII
“Oh, more or less.” I fancy my smile was pale. “Not absolutely. We<br>shouldn’t like that!” I went on.<br>“No—I suppose we shouldn’t. Of course we have the others.”<br>“We have the others—we have indeed the others,” I concurred.<br>“Yet even though we have them,” he returned, still with his hands in<br>his pockets and planted there in front of me, “they don’t much count,<br>do they?”<br>I made the best of it, but I felt wan. “It depends on what you call<br>‘much’!”<br>“Yes”—with all accommodation—“everything depends!” On this, however, he<br>faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague,<br>restless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with his forehead<br>against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I knew and the<br>dull things of

. I had always my hypocrisy of “work,” behind<br>which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with it there as I had<br>repeatedly done at those moments of torment that I have described as<br>the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from<br>which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared<br>for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I<br>extracted a meaning from the boy’s embarrassed back—none other than the<br>impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in

 to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct<br>perception that it was positively _he_ who was. The frames and squares<br>of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of<br>failure. I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He<br>was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope.<br>Wasn’t he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn’t<br>see?—and wasn’t it the first time in the whole business that he had<br>known such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it a splendid<br>portent. It made him anxious, though he watched himself; he had been<br>anxious

 and, even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat<br>at table, had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss.<br>When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this<br>genius had succumbed. “Well, I think I’m glad Bly agrees with _me!_”<br>“You would certainly seem to have seen, these

, a good<br>deal more of it than for some time before. I hope,” I went on bravely,<br>“that you’ve been enjoying yourself.”<br>“Oh, yes, I’ve been ever so far; all round about—miles and miles away.<br>I’ve never been so free.”<br>He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with<br>him. “Well, do you like it?”<br>He stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words—“Do<br>_you?_”—more discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain.<br>Before I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with<br>the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. “Nothing could<br>be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone<br>together now it’s you that are alone most. But I hope,” he threw in,<br>“you don’t particularly mind!”<br>“Having to do with you?” I asked. “My dear child, how can I help<br>minding? Though I’ve renounced all claim to your company—you’re so<br>beyond me—I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?”<br>He looked at me more directly, and the expression of his face, graver<br>now, struck me as the most beautiful I had ever found in it. “You stay<br>on just for _that?_”<br>“Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest I<br>take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth<br>your while. That needn’t surprise you.” My voice trembled so that I<br>felt it impossible to suppress the shake. “Don’t you remember how I<br>told you, when I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that<br>there was nothing in the world I wouldn’t do for you?”<br>“Yes, yes!” He, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone<br>to master; but he was so much more successful than I that, laughing out<br>through his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting. “Only
that, I think, was to get me to do something for _you!_”<br>“It was partly to get you to do something,” I conceded. “But, you know,<br>you didn’t do it.”<br>“Oh, yes,” he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, “you<br>wanted me to tell you something.”<br>“That’s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.”<br>“Ah, then, is _that_ what you’ve stayed over for?”<br>He spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest<br>little quiver of resentful passion; but I can’t begin to express the<br>effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint. It was as<br>if what I had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me. “Well,<br>yes—I may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely for<br>that.”<br>He waited so long that I supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the<br>assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally<br>said was: “Do you mean now—here?”<br>“There couldn’t be a better place or time.” He looked round him<br>uneasily, and I had the rare—oh, the queer!—impression of the very<br>first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It<br>was as if he were suddenly afraid of me—which struck me indeed as<br>perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort<br>I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so<br>gentle as to be almost grotesque. “You want so to go out again?”<br>“Awfully!” He smiled at me heroically, and the touching little bravery<br>of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain. He had picked up<br>his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling it in a way that<br>gave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of<br>what I was doing. To do it in _any_ way was an act of violence, for<br>what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and<br>guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of<br>the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn’t it base to create<br>for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read<br>into our situation a clearness it couldn’t have had at the time, for I<br>seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a<br>prevision of the anguish that was to come. So we circled about, with<br>terrors and scruples, like fighters not daring to close. But it was for<br>each other we feared! That kept us a little longer suspended and<br>unbruised. “I’ll tell you everything,” Miles said—“I mean I’ll tell you<br>anything you like. You’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all<br>right, and I _will_ tell you—I _will_. But not now.”<br>“Why not now?”<br>My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window<br>in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop.<br>Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside,<br>someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. “I have to see<br>Luke.”<br>I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt<br>proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my<br>truth. I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting. “Well, then,<br>go to Luke, and I’ll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for<br>that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request.”<br>He looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a<br>little to bargain. “Very much smaller—?”<br>“Yes, a mere fraction of the whole. Tell me”—oh, my work preoccupied<br>me, and I was offhand!—“if,

 from something<br>that I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention—a stroke<br>that at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind<br>movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just<br>fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively<br>keeping him with his back to the window. The appearance was full upon<br>us that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into<br>view like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that,<br>from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to<br>the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room<br>his white face of damnation. It represents but grossly what took place<br>within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made;<br>yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time<br>recovered her grasp of the _act_. It came to me in the very horror of<br>the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what I<br>saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration—I can<br>call it by no other name—was that I felt how voluntarily, how<br>transcendently, I _might_. It was like fighting with a demon for a<br>human soul, and when I had fairly so appraised it I saw how the human<br>soul—held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm’s length—had a perfect<br>dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to<br>mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it<br>presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further<br>away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance.<br>“Yes—I took it.”<br>At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I<br>held him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his<br>little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I kept my eyes on<br>the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture. I have<br>likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather<br>the prowl of a baffled beast. My present quickened courage, however,<br>was such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade, as it<br>were, my flame. Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the<br>window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was the very<br>confidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive<br>certitude, by this time, of the child’s unconsciousness, that made me<br>go on. “What did you take it for?”<br>“To see what you said about me.”<br>“You opened the letter?”<br>“I opened it.”<br>My eyes were now, as I held him off a little again, on Miles’s own<br>face, in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the<br>ravage of uneasiness. What was prodigious was that at last, by my<br>success, his sense was sealed and his communication stopped: he knew<br>that he was in presence, but knew not of what, and knew still less that<br>I also was and that I did know. And what did this strain of trouble<br>matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air<br>was clear again and—by my personal triumph—the influence quenched?<br>There was nothing there. I felt that the cause was mine and that I<br>should surely get _all_. “And you found nothing!”—I let my elation out.<br>He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake. “Nothing.”<br>“Nothing, nothing!” I almost shouted in my joy.<br>“Nothing, nothing,” he sadly repeated.<br>I kissed his forehead; it was drenched. “So what have you done with<br>it?”<br>“I’ve burned it.”<br>“Burned it?” It was now or never. “Is that what you did at school?”<br>Oh, what this brought up! “At school?”<br>“Did you take letters?—or other things?”<br>“Other things?” He appeared now to be thinking of something far off and<br>that reached him only through the pressure of his anxiety. Yet it did<br>reach him. “Did I _steal?_”<br>I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it<br>were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him<br>take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the<br>world. “Was it for that you mightn’t go back?”<br>The only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. “Did you<br>know I mightn’t go back?”<br>“I know everything.”<br>He gave me at this the longest and strangest look. “Everything?”<br>“Everything. Therefore _did_ you—?” But I couldn’t say it again.<br>Miles could, very simply. “No. I didn’t steal.”<br>My face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands—but it<br>was for pure tenderness—shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all<br>for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. “What then did<br>you do?”<br>He looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his<br>breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have<br>been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some<br>faint green twilight. “Well—I said things.”<br>“Only that?”<br>“They thought it was enough!”<br>“To turn you out for?”<br>Never, truly, had a person “turned out” shown so little to explain it<br>as this little person! He appeared to weigh my question, but in a<br>manner quite detached and almost helpless. “Well, I suppose I<br>oughtn’t.”<br>“But to whom did you say them?”<br>He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped—he had lost it. “I don’t<br>know!”<br>He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender, which was<br>indeed practically, by this time, so complete that I ought to have left<br>it there. But I was infatuated—I was blind with victory, though even<br>then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was<br>already that of added separation. “Was it to everyone?” I asked.<br>“No; it was only to—” But he gave a sick little headshake. “I don’t<br>remember their names.”<br>“Were they then so many?”<br>“No—only a few. Those I liked.”<br>Those he liked? I seemed to float not into clearness, but into a darker<br>obscure, and within

 there had come to me out of my very pity<br>the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the<br>instant confounding and bottomless, for if he _were_ innocent, what<br>then on earth was _I?_ Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of<br>the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh,<br>he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear<br>window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him<br>from. “And did they repeat what you said?” I went on after a moment.<br>He was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again<br>with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined<br>against his will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked up at the<br>dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but<br>an unspeakable anxiety. “Oh, yes,” he nevertheless replied—“they must<br>have repeated them. To those _they_ liked,” he added.<br>There was, somehow, less of it than I had expected; but I turned it<br>over. “And these things came round—?”<br>“To the masters? Oh, yes!” he answered very simply. “But I didn’t know<br>they’d tell.”<br>“The masters? They didn’t—they’ve never told. That’s why I ask you.”<br>He turned to me again his little beautiful fevered face. “Yes, it was<br>too bad.”<br>“Too bad?”<br>“What I suppose I sometimes said. To write home.”<br>I can’t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a<br>speech by such a speaker; I only know that the next instant I heard<br>myself throw off with homely force: “Stuff and nonsense!” But the next<br>after that I must have sounded stern enough. “What _were_ these<br>things?”<br>My sternness was all for his judge, his executioner; yet it made him<br>avert himself again, and that movement made _me_, with a single bound<br>and an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon him. For there again,<br>against the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his answer,<br>was the hideous author of our woe—the white face of damnation. I felt a<br>sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle, so<br>that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal.<br>I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on<br>the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was<br>still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the<br>climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. “No more,<br>no more, no more!” I shrieked, as I tried to press him against me, to<br>my visitant.<br>“Is she _here?_” Miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the<br>direction of my words. Then as his strange “she” staggered me and, with<br>a gasp, I echoed it, “Miss Jessel, Miss Jessel!” he with a sudden fury<br>gave me back.<br>I seized, stupefied, his supposition—some sequel to what we had done to<br>Flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still<br>than that. “It’s not Miss Jessel! But it’s at the window—straight<br>before us. It’s _there_—the coward horror, there for the last time!”<br>At this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a<br>baffled dog’s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air<br>and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly<br>over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled<br>the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence.<br>“It’s _he?_”<br>I was so determined to have all my proof that I flashed into ice to<br>challenge him. “Whom do you mean by ‘he’?”<br>“Peter Quint—you devil!” His face gave again, round the room, its<br>convulsed supplication. “_Where?_”<br>They are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his<br>tribute to my devotion. “What does he matter now, my own?—what will he<br>_ever_ matter? _I_ have you,” I launched at the beast, “but he has lost<br>you forever!” Then, for the demonstration of my work, “There, _there!_”<br>I said to Miles.<br>But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and<br>seen but the quiet day. With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of<br>he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp<br>with which I recovered him might have been that of catching him in

 began to feel what it truly was<br>that I held. We were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart,<br>dispossessed, had stopped.</div>
